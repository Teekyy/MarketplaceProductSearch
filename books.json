        "description": "On his planet, husbands own their wives. Julie is desperate to travel to Tarrkua and join her sister--the only family she has left in this universe. But to reach the distant alien planet, she must assume the identity of another Earth woman who's supposed to marry a Tarrkuan. Can she pull off the switch without her new alien husband learning of her deceit? After years spent in the asteroid mines, Varro returns to his home planet only to discover his betrothed has married another. Angry and hurt, he vows to never trust another female again, though he knows he must fulfill his duties to his people and procreate as soon as possible. Now he must take the human bride who's offered to him--a stranger from Earth, no less. But warmth fills him the moment he first glimpses his little bride, and her sweet demeanor soon wins him over. Perhaps an arranged marriage to a human is what the Gods had intended for him all along. Once Julie and Varro are married, he takes her home and claims her thoroughly, leaving no doubt in her mind that she now belongs to him. He also informs her that he's more than her husband--he's also her master--and she's expected to obey his every command. When she's naughty, he doesn't hesitate to apply a sturdy leather strap to her bottom. But he also possesses a gentler side and she can't help falling for the strict but loving alien. She also can't help but shudder in ecstasy as he claims her roughly, time and time again, leaving her breathless and trembling for his masterful touch. But all lies eventually unravel. What will Varro do when he learns of her deceit?",

In The Mirror of Her Dreams, the astonishing first novel in the two-volume Mordant\u2019s Need series, Donaldson shows us a world of wondrous beauty and seductive illusion, where mirrors hold the deadliest of magics and nothing is what it seems. . . . The daughter of rich but neglectful parents, Terisa Morgan lives alone in a New York City apartment, a young woman who has grown to doubt her own existence. Surrounded by the flat reassurance of mirrors, she leads an unfulfilled life\u2014until the night a strange man named Geraden comes crashing through one of her mirrors, on a quest to find a champion to save his kingdom of Mordant from a pervasive evil that threatens the land. Terisa is no champion. She wields neither magic nor power. And yet, much to her own surprise, when Geraden begs her to come back with him, she agrees. Now, in a culture where women are little more than the playthings of powerful men, in a castle honeycombed with secret passages and clever traps, in a kingdom threatened from without and within by enemies able to appear and vanish out of thin air, Terisa must become more than the pale reflection of a person. For the way back to Earth is closed to her. And the enemies of Mordant will stop at nothing to see her dead.",

        "description": "Hope\u2019s had her eye on Charlie for a long time, for all the good it\u2019s done her. He\u2019s not even aware of her existence\u2014other than as a fellow agent working Black Ops for the CIA. Her friends, Glory, Honor, and Charity, found men to love, so Hope knows it\u2019s possible. But the odds aren\u2019t in her favor. Not in a world of normal humans where she\u2019s a genetically modified aberration. Hell, even she refers to her kind as freaks. What man in his right mind would want one of those in his bed? Charlie swore off women after his last marriage went down in drama-tipped flames fifteen years ago. His first mistress is danger. He fell in love with the adrenaline rush when he signed on as a Navy Seal right out of college, and he never got over the thrill of pitting himself against the impossible. Hope caught his eye the night she escaped her compound, but years of ignoring anything resembling a feeling made it easy to ignore the attraction\u2014until they\u2019re paired on a mission. Her intelligence and resourcefulness impress the hell out of him, but her half-naked body, exposed after an animal attack, forces him to face feelings he was certain he\u2019d buried for good.",

A detective on the edge of madness. The future of time travel at stake. From the author of The Warehouse . . . ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: NPR, Kirkus Reviews January Cole\u2019s job just got a whole lot harder. Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really easy. Nothing\u2019s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their \u201cflights\u201d to the past. Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion\u2014and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls. None of that compares to the corpse in room 526. The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January can see. On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology\u2014and the world\u2019s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims. January is sure the timing isn\u2019t a coincidence. Neither are those \u201caccidents\u201d that start stalking their bidders. There\u2019s a reason January can glimpse what others can\u2019t. A reason why she\u2019s the only one who can catch a killer who\u2019s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once. But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality\u2014and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not just the hotel\u2019s dark secrets but her own. At once a dazzlingly time-twisting murder mystery and a story about grief, memory, and what it means to\u2014literally\u2014come face-to-face with our ghosts, The Paradox Hotel is another unforgettable speculative thrill ride from acclaimed author Rob Hart.",

Beautiful young Charity Freestone has it all: the love of a good man, the revelation of her remarkable identity, and her family reunited after their spectacular battle with the Sons of the Crystal Mind. However, at her moment of triumph Charity is tricked into joining the mysterious New Form Enterprise, whose harsh regime seems designed to break her. Before she can learn their strange purpose, a shocking betrayal brings unique and terrifying freedom. Cut off from its advanced technology, Charity is hunted through war-torn, subterranean Diamond City by an enemy who is always closer than she thinks. As she struggles to make sense of her inhumanly ruthless pursuers, Charity must confront her own complicity in the nightmare that engulfs her. And when she does, she discovers there are far worse places than the dreaded Outer Spheres. Book Two of Andrew Wallace\u2019s viscerally thrilling Diamond Roads science fiction series, The Outer Spheres takes extraordinary heroine Charity Freestone into even stranger and more disturbing territory. The novel threads bleeding-edge science through a fearsomely-wrought war story to explore the unimaginable outcomes of our most terrifying decisions. Blending the vast and eerie scale of Peter F Hamilton\u2019s The Reality Dysfunction with the originality and political insight of Anne Leckie\u2019s Ancilliary Justice, The Outer Spheres forges a unique vision of fear and wonder. Diamond Roads is fast becoming a whole new mythology, exploring the way things are against a wildly-imagined backdrop of how they might turn out. To see if Charity survives, and whether she can be truly free of her pursuers and her own demons, buy the book now.

        "description": "One dark and stormy night, a stranger arrives in West Sussex at a village inn. He is heavily clad in an overcoat and his face is wrapped in bandages. He takes a room at the inn, but refuses to socialize with anyone. He stays cooped up in his room all day and night, working with strange chemicals and apparatus. Suddenly, strange events begin to happen in the village. Mysterious burglaries and fires break out, culminating in a destructive rampage across the peaceful countryside. The stranger is the keeper of a terrible secret... The Invisible Man: A Grotesque Romance (to give the book its full title) by HG Wells was published in 1897. Written in novella form, this bizarre science fiction tale was first published in Pearson's Weekly as a serial and later compiled into a single book. Based on scientific theories of optics and physics, this story instantly caught the imagination of readers and has been regularly adapted to film, television and radio since it first made its appearance more than a hundred years ago. Herbert George Wells' writing career owes itself to an accident suffered in childhood. As an eight year old boy, he was once confined to bed with a broken leg. His father, a professional cricketer and failed businessman, regularly brought him books from the local library so that he could pass the time. His father's financial troubles compelled his mother to go to work as a lady's maid in a local mansion, while the children were put to work as apprentices with various local tradesmen. For Wells, this was one of the most unhappy, yet also the most profitable times in his life. The mansion where his mother worked had an enormous library where the child continued to read and educate himself. At eighteen, he went to work as a teacher in a residential school. His career flourished after that, and he won a scholarship to work under the great biologist, Thomas Huxley in London. He began writing science fiction stories in 1895 with the publication of The Time Machine, where he proposed the concept of selective time travel. Several other extremely popular Sci-Fi novels and short stories followed, interspersed with romantic stories, novels, ghost stories, film scripts, articles, satirical novels, historical and political treatises and non-fiction papers. Wells was an extremely prolific writer and continues to inspire generations of writers even today. The Invisible Man is a book that evokes great interest among readers of all ages and is an important landmark in the history of Sci-Fi writing. One dark and stormy night, a stranger arrives in West Sussex at a village inn. He is heavily clad in an overcoat and his face is wrapped in bandages. He takes a room at the inn, but refuses to socialize with anyone. He stays cooped up in his room all day and night, working with strange chemicals and apparatus.

        "description": "The Invisible Man is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse it. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction.This is a classic science-fiction book with over 100 pages of pure excitement and wonder. The Invisible Man may start out slowly, but once you pay close attention, the book becomes a spine-tingling thriller that will leave you breathless. It all starts when a mysterious stranger comes into the town of Iping, all wrapped up in bandages. He never takes off his glasses, bandages, or coat, and brings all sorts of strange chemicals in little bottles with him. He sits in his hotel room all day, working with the chemicals. No one knows what he's doing, but eventually, people get suspicious. Who is this disguised man? Is he a criminal in hiding? Or maybe he's horribly disfigured! All the same, they want to get a glimpse of this strange man's face. Just imagine their surprise when they find out that this man is invisible! I would definitely inspire anyone who likes a good hard read and science-fiction to read this fantastic novel",

Delving deeply into the work of major figures in the field - from Jack Kirby's cosmic superhero sagas and Philip K. Dick's futuristic head-trips to Alan Moore's sex magic and Whitley Strieber's communion with visitors - Kripal shows how creators turned to science fiction to convey the reality of the inexplicable and the paranormal they experienced in their lives. Expanded consciousness found its language in the metaphors of sci-fi - incredible powers, unprecedented mutations, time-loops and vast intergalactic intelligences - and the deeper influences of mythology and religion that these in turn drew from ; the wildly creative work that followed caught the imaginations of millions. Moving deftly from Cold War science and Fredric Wertham's anticomics crusade to gnostic revelation and alien abduction, Kripal spins out a hidden history of American culture, rich with mythical themes and shot through with an awareness that there are other realities far beyond our everyday understanding.\"--Jacket.",

What readers are saying: If you like mysteries and/or sci-fi you will love this book!!! \"This is a very good story that has your heart pounding as you turn the pages. Intrigue, nefarious plots, twists and turns around every corner - great series, even if you're not a fan of science fiction.\" \"From the moment I read the first paragraph of Paragon, up until the last sentence, I was enthralled. Non-stop, on edge, exciting action. I honestly couldn't put a fault on this one, I loved all of it, including the song! The Fractured Era series is still up there amongst my favourite novels of the year.\" \"Full of questions, traitors galore, secrets & suspicions. You can't even trust your own family in this world!\" Phenomenal...that's the best word to describe it. Autumn Kalquist manages to weave a tale that is jam packed with suspense and whodunit plots. Just loved it with it many twists and turns that keeps you on your toes. The characters were great and you just didn't know who to trust in the conspiracy that was going on. ...Highly recommended series and anxious to read the next book. I love all of this author's books. I have read many post-apocalyptic and dystopian tales and this is different from all the rest. She always keeps me guessing. My only complaint is she doesn\u2019t write them fast enough!! I believe this is the first 5 star rating I've ever given. LOVED IT! Such a great follow up to Legacy Code (which ended up on my Top Ten 2014 list) I love Autumn's writing style, she is so talented and takes you right there alongside the characters. This is a beautiful and unique story and I can't wait to read more!! \"In a story where I fell in love with the characters, it is easy to have your heart broken, have a smile on your face, or cry over a simple scene in the book. This is one series I would never stop reading, and admittedly, have read on more than one occasion!\" \"This series has me intrigued, it feels realistic, real and frightening at the same time. Humanity is alone in space in their fleet of ships and they have nowhere to go, they try to find a better earth, a new home. I want to know if they ever find it.\" keywords: science fiction best sellers, top sci-fi books, top science fiction books, best sci-fi fantasy books, genetic engineering science fiction series, best science fiction novels, genetic engineering, space colony, space colonization, space opera, apocalypse, post-apocalyptic, generation ship, end of the world, space battle, space explorer",

Delving deeply into the work of major figures in the field - from Jack Kirby's cosmic superhero sagas and Philip K. Dick's futuristic head-trips to Alan Moore's sex magic and Whitley Strieber's communion with visitors - Kripal shows how creators turned to science fiction to convey the reality of the inexplicable and the paranormal they experienced in their lives. Expanded consciousness found its language in the metaphors of sci-fi - incredible powers, unprecedented mutations, time-loops and vast intergalactic intelligences - and the deeper influences of mythology and religion that these in turn drew from ; the wildly creative work that followed caught the imaginations of millions. Moving deftly from Cold War science and Fredric Wertham's anticomics crusade to gnostic revelation and alien abduction, Kripal spins out a hidden history of American culture, rich with mythical themes and shot through with an awareness that there are other realities far beyond our everyday understanding.\"--Jacket.",

But there was something they couldn't leave behind: The Legacy Code\u2014mangled genes that force them to abort half their unborn children. When Era and Dritan Corinth get placements on the safest ship in the fleet and win a chance to have a child, they feel lucky. Until the day Era's supposed to find out if her baby has the Defect, and the ship suffers a hull breach. An investigation uncovers new threats: Dangerous secrets. Lies. Treason. Era begins to question everything she\u2019s been taught about the fleet, their search for a new Earth, and the Defect. But the answers she seeks were never meant to be found... Legacy Code is a suspenseful and dark genetic engineering science fiction series that has earned five star reviews from fans of some of the best sci-fi and fantasy books like Hunger Games, Divergent, and Red Rising, and has been compared favorably to Wool, 1984, and the new Battlestar Galactica. \"Addictive sci-fi series. I haven't been this hooked on an author since Anne McCaffery's Killashandra series.\" ~ Marie Hall, New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Author What Readers are Saying: \u201cOne of the best books I've ever read, I can't wait to read the rest of the series.\u201d \u201cSpace, spaceships, planets, wormholes, dystopian, pregnancy, oh my! I thoroughly enjoyed Legacy Code. It was a quick read for me, as I found it hard to put down. After the first few chapters I was hooked & couldn't get enough\u2026 A great mix of SciFi & Dystopian! One of my top favourite reads for 2014.\u201d \u201cCompelling post-apocalyptic novel about survival: Wow. That was... astounding. I really enjoyed reading this\u2026 Living in space inside space ships? Holograms? Post-apocalypse? Heck, yeah!\u201d \u201cI cannot get enough of the Fractured Era series. It's the best sci-fi series I've read since The Post-Human series by David Simpson.\u201d \u201c\u2026An uncertain future has the colonists on edge, leading to acts of terrorism and assassination attempts on government officials\u2026 There are several intriguing elements at play, most significantly, the mystery of the Legacy Code and whether it holds the key to humanity's survival\u2026I'm looking forward to continuing the series to see where it goes from here.\u201d \u201cA couple of chapters in and I was already hooked! I ended up staying up til midnight (as a mother of a toddler this is a rare occasion) in order to finish it.\u201d \u201cI just finished this book...at 6:00 AM. This society crafted by Autumn Kalquist is fascinating. I can't even imagine how much time she spent carefully plotting every detail. Their existence feels so real and so frighteningly possible.\u201d \u201cIt kind of had an initial feel of Battlestar Galactica -- a civilization that has to abandon their planet and go in search of a new one. \u2026It had mystery, a bit of a thriller like aspect, humor, and a taste of romance.\" \u201cI both love and hate this book...but in a good way! Instantly I fell in love with the characters and storyline that Kalquist spun together\u2026This story is based in the future (almost a space opera / dystopian) where the populations of earth escaped to space to find a better world. ...we arrive in a distant future where civilization exists on space ships and they have to take decades before making jumps across space -similar in a way to what I imagine Stargate\u201d \u201cIt pulled me in faster than most books I have read and kept me on the edge of my seat through the end.

A strange man discovers our nameless narrator selling popcorn at a decrepit small-town movie theater and offers her an odd and lucrative position: she will forget her job, her acquaintances, even her name, and move to Los Angeles, where she will become the body double of the famous and troubled celebrity Rosanna Feld. A nervous breakdown has forced Rosanna out of the public eye, and she needs a look-alike to take her place in the tabloid media circus of Hollywood. Overseen by Max, who hired her for the job, our narrator spends her days locked up in a small apartment in the hills watching hidden camera footage of Rosanna, wearing Rosanna's clothes, eating the food Rosanna likes, practicing her mannerisms, learning to become Rosanna in every way. But as she makes her public debut as Rosanna, alarming questions begin to arise. What really caused Rosanna's mental collapse? Will she ever return? And is Max truly her ally, or something more sinister?",

Carson's incredible discoveries, including the remains of two bodies, one of then on a ceremonial bed facing an altar that appeared to be a means of communicating with the Gods and the other lying in a porcelain sarcophagus in the Inner Chamber, permitted him to piece together the whole fabric of that extraordinary civilization.",

        "author": "Peter F. Hamilton",
        "description": "NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY New York Times bestselling author Peter F. Hamilton\u2019s riveting new thriller combines the nail-biting suspense of a serial-killer investigation with clear-eyed scientific and social extrapolation to create a future that seems not merely plausible but inevitable. A century from now, thanks to a technology allowing instantaneous travel across light-years, humanity has solved its energy shortages, cleaned up the environment, and created far-flung colony worlds. The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family\u2014composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another, the original three clone \u201cbrothers\u201d have gone their separate ways, and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies. Or maybe not so friendly. At least that\u2019s what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who\u2019d like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it, whether he solves the crime or not, he\u2019ll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid\u2019s case is about to take an unexpected turn: because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra, where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood. The convicted slayer, Angela Tramelo, has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime.

        "author": "Andrew Wallace",
        "description": "How can such a bright future be so full of darkness? Beautiful young Charity Freestone has it all: the love of a good man, the revelation of her remarkable identity, and her family reunited after their spectacular battle with the Sons of the Crystal Mind. However, at her moment of triumph Charity is tricked into joining the mysterious New Form Enterprise, whose harsh regime seems designed to break her. Before she can learn their strange purpose, a shocking betrayal brings unique and terrifying freedom. Cut off from its advanced technology, Charity is hunted through war-torn, subterranean Diamond City by an enemy who is always closer than she thinks. As she struggles to make sense of her inhumanly ruthless pursuers, Charity must confront her own complicity in the nightmare that engulfs her. And when she does, she discovers there are far worse places than the dreaded Outer Spheres. Book Two of Andrew Wallace\u2019s viscerally thrilling Diamond Roads science fiction series, The Outer Spheres takes extraordinary heroine Charity Freestone into even stranger and more disturbing territory. The novel threads bleeding-edge science through a fearsomely-wrought war story to explore the unimaginable outcomes of our most terrifying decisions. Blending the vast and eerie scale of Peter F Hamilton\u2019s The Reality Dysfunction with the originality and political insight of Anne Leckie\u2019s Ancilliary Justice, The Outer Spheres forges a unique vision of fear and wonder. Diamond Roads is fast becoming a whole new mythology, exploring the way things are against a wildly-imagined backdrop of how they might turn out. To see if Charity survives, and whether she can be truly free of her pursuers and her own demons, buy the book now. Praise for Diamond Roads: Andrew Wallace shows a real talent for world building in this well-written, fast-paced debut novel. From the first page, Diamond Roads is packed with sci-fi smarts. I\u2019m looking forward to reading more from this author \u2013 Anne Charnock, winner of the Clarke Award for Dreams Before the Start of Time & the BSFA Award for The Enclave Fast-paced, clever and beautifully written, Diamond Roads is a richly imagined dystopian thriller that introduces the latest in a long line of cool, kick-ass SF heroines. Charity Freestone combines the strength of Ripley with the wiles of Katniss and the vulnerability of Halo Jones. If you liked Wool, you'll love this \u2013 Mark Edwards, bestselling author of The Magpies & Follow You Home I loved this smart, continually surprising thriller set in a richly drawn world \u2013 Simon Guerrier, author of Doctor Who: The Pirate Loop; Primeval: Fire & Water & Being Human: The Road",

        "description": "Here are 25 stories of science fiction that push the envelope, by the biggest names in an emerging new crop of high-tech futuristic SF - including Charles Stross, Robert Reed, Alastair Reynolds, Peter Hamilton and Neal Asher. High-tech SF has made a significant comeback in the last decade, as bestselling authors successfully blend the super-science of 'hard science fiction' with real characters in an understandable scenario. It is perhaps a reflection of how technologically controlled our world is that readers increasingly look for science fiction that considers the fates of mankind as a result of increasing scientific domination. This anthology brings together the most extreme examples of the new high-tech, far-future science fiction, pushing the limits way beyond normal boundaries. The stories include: \"A Perpetual War Fought Within a Cosmic String\", \"A Weapon That Could Destroy the Universe\", \"A Machine That Detects Alternate Worlds and Creates a Choice of Christs\", \"An Immortal Dead Man Sent To The End of the Universe\", \"Murder in Virtual Reality\", \"A Spaceship So Large That There is An Entire Planetary System Within It\", and \"An Analytical Engine At The End of Time\", and \"Encountering the Untouchable.\"",

To control the past, they edited history. To control the future, they edited literature. LONDON, 1953. Thirteen years have passed since England surrendered to the Nazis and formed a Grand Alliance with Germany. It was forced to adopt many of its oppressive ideologies, one of which was the strict classification of women into hierarchical groups based on the perceived value they brought to society. Rose Ransom, a member of the privileged Geli class, remembers life from before the war but knows better than to let it show. She works for the Ministry of Culture, rewriting the classics of English literature to ensure there are no subversive thoughts that will give women any ideas. Outbreaks of insurgency have been seen across the country with graffiti made up of seditious lines from forbidden works by women painted on public buildings. Suspicion has fallen on Widowland, the run-down slums where childless women over fifty have been banished. Rose is given the dangerous task of infiltrating Widowland to find the source of the rebellion before the Leader arrives in England for the Coronation ceremony of King Edward VIII and Queen Wallis. Will Rose follow her instructions and uncover the criminals? Or will she fight for what she knows in her heart is right?

Strange that fate should throw them together now, among the last group of students admitted after the start of the semester. They had once shared the strongest of friendships. But that all ended a long time ago. But when an insufferable but politically important woman turns up murdered, the two agree to put their differences aside and work together to solve the case.

Now traitors plot against the fleet, and he's tasked with hunting them down and stopping them. Permanently. Tadeo was born to command, born to lead the last remnants of humanity to a new Earth. He knows there\u2019s a better world out there: Daylight at the end of humanity's long night. And he's willing to do whatever it takes to get the fleet there. Even if it means walking the line between loyalty and treason. And breaking the rules... Again. Legacy Code is a suspenseful and dark genetic engineering science fiction series that has earned five star reviews from fans of some of the best sci-fi and fantasy books like Hunger Games, Divergent, and Red Rising, and has been compared favorably to Wool, 1984, and the new Battlestar Galactica. What readers are saying: If you like mysteries and/or sci-fi you will love this book!!! \"This is a very good story that has your heart pounding as you turn the pages. Intrigue, nefarious plots, twists and turns around every corner - great series, even if you're not a fan of science fiction.\" \"From the moment I read the first paragraph of Paragon, up until the last sentence, I was enthralled. Non-stop, on edge, exciting action. I honestly couldn't put a fault on this one, I loved all of it, including the song! The Fractured Era series is still up there amongst my favourite novels of the year.\" \"Full of questions, traitors galore, secrets & suspicions. You can't even trust your own family in this world!\" Phenomenal...that's the best word to describe it. Autumn Kalquist manages to weave a tale that is jam packed with suspense and whodunit plots. Just loved it with it many twists and turns that keeps you on your toes. The characters were great and you just didn't know who to trust in the conspiracy that was going on. ...Highly recommended series and anxious to read the next book. I love all of this author's books. I have read many post-apocalyptic and dystopian tales and this is different from all the rest. She always keeps me guessing. My only complaint is she doesn\u2019t write them fast enough!! I believe this is the first 5 star rating I've ever given. LOVED IT! Such a great follow up to Legacy Code (which ended up on my Top Ten 2014 list) I love Autumn's writing style, she is so talented and takes you right there alongside the characters. This is a beautiful and unique story and I can't wait to read more!! \"In a story where I fell in love with the characters, it is easy to have your heart broken, have a smile on your face, or cry over a simple scene in the book. This is one series I would never stop reading, and admittedly, have read on more than one occasion!\" \"This series has me intrigued, it feels realistic, real and frightening at the same time. Humanity is alone in space in their fleet of ships and they have nowhere to go, they try to find a better earth, a new home. I want to know if they ever find it.\" keywords: science fiction best sellers, top sci-fi books, top science fiction books, best sci-fi fantasy books, genetic engineering science fiction series, best science fiction novels, genetic engineering, space colony, space colonization, space opera, apocalypse, post-apocalyptic, generation ship, end of the world, space battle, space explorer",

Just about everybody. What\u2019s he done? A bit of everything\u2014smuggler, revolutionary, whatever crooked little scheme will pay for his next meal or next drink. But Eddie\u2019s latest caper is one he may not be able to escape...even if he wants to. Stumbling into a fight between a couple of Berber chieftains, Eddie lands in a prison run by The Black Sultan. He may be a captive of the Sultan, but he\u2019s captivated by a stunning young woman the Sultan means to add to his harem. For her, Eddie might just go straight\u2014if he can get them out of this hellhole alive. When The Black Sultan was originally published, Hubbard said that writers too often \u201cforget a great deal of the languorous quality which made the Arabian Nights so pleasing. Jewels, beautiful women, towering cities filled with mysterious shadows, sultans equally handy with robes of honor and the beheading sword.... These things still exist, undimmed, losing no luster to the permeating Occidental flavor which reaches even the far corners of the earth today.\u201d Hubbard brings this unique insight to his stories of North Africa and the Legionnaires, investing them with an authenticity of time, place and character that kept his readers asking for more. Also includes the adventure story, \u201cEscape for Three,\u201d in which a bold trio of French Legionnaires come to the rescue of their great leader\u2014only to decide he may not be so great after all. \u201cAction, strong characters, suspense, snappy dialogue, and titillating romance.\u201d \u2014Publishers Weekly",

The alien promised to take Kaishi and her friends back to Earth, to home. Instead, Ignos has brought them to its own world, teeming with other parasites that see the humans as hosts, and a potential gateway to their own survival. The Sevora make an offer to Kaishi: join with them, take their technology, and forge a new destiny for both species together. With the Sevora, of course, controlling their human hosts. Across the stars, Sax escapes the crumbling space station and finds himself at odds with his own race and galactic law. Picked up by salvagers who see him as a valuable piece of living scrap, Sax must learn how to live outside the structure that gave him his power, even while he tries to find a way to bring it down.

But books won\u2019t protect him from Her Imperial Majesty Lionstone XIV, who just Outlawed and condemned Owen to death, without any explanation, reason, or warning. No wonder she\u2019s called the Iron Bitch. Now, on the run from Imperial starcruisers, shady mercenaries, and just about everyone else in the Empire, Owen\u2019s options are limited. Though the name Deathstalker still commands respect in certain quarters, out on the Rim, Owen is lucky he can cobble together a makeshift team of castoffs, including an ex-pirate, a cyborg, and a bounty hunter. But allies won\u2019t be enough to save him. If he\u2019s to live, Owen can either run forever...or take down the corrupt Empire. To do that, he\u2019ll need the fabled Darkvoid Device\u2014an artifact dating back to the first Deathstalker and perhaps the only weapon powerful enough to help this ragtag rebellion win. The time has come for Owen to finally embrace his Deathstalker heritage...and all the blood and death that go along with it. Deathstalker is the first book in New York Times bestselling author Simon R. Green\u2019s beloved space opera series.",

        "description": "Freeman is a genius with an uncommon mixture of memory, intelligence and creativity. He lives in a worldwide utopia, but it was not always so. There was a time known as the Grind\u2014when Freeman's people lived as slaves to another race referred to simply as \"Master.\" They were property. But a civil rights movement emerged. Change seemed near, but the Masters refused to bend. Instead, they declared war. And lost. Now, the freed world is threatened by a virus, spread through bites, sweeping through the population. Those infected are propelled to violence, driven to disperse the virus. Uniquely suited to respond to this new threat, Freeman searches for a cure, but instead finds the source\u2014the Masters, intent on reclaiming the world. Freeman must fight for his life, for his friends and for the truth, which is far more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined. Robinson's lightning fast, cutting-edge novels have won over thriller, horror, science-fiction and action/adventure fans alike, and he has received high praise from peers like James Rollins, Jonathan Maberry, and Scott Sigler. XOM-B is a wildly inventive zombie novel with a high-tech twist that will keep readers guessing until the very last sentence.",

But when his ship sails into port, a beautiful woman wearing the garb of an inquisitor from one of the religious orders waits to arrest him. His crime? He\u2019s accused of stealing an ancient artifact with the power to start another war. Jev would gladly hand over the artifact to stop more suffering, but he has no idea where it is or even what it looks like. The inquisitor woman definitely has the wrong person.

All she has to do is find the Eye of Truth, and her superiors are certain that Jev has it. He tries to charm her with his twinkling eyes and easy smile, but she\u2019s not letting any man get between her and her dreams. Especially not a thief. If Jev can\u2019t convince Zenia they\u2019re on the same side, find the artifact, and clear his name, his homecoming will turn into a jail sentence. Or worse.",

The only way to stop the Craing this time will be to square off with them on their home turf. Jason's been informed that three powerful Craing warships, having similar technology as The Lilly, will soon be en route to Earth. The Alliance must destroy the Craing's wormhole means of distant space travel to avert Earth's total annihilation. Unfortunately, there's no way to reach the Craing worlds in time, at least not through conventional means. It's up to Jason and his hand-picked assault team to traverse, by advanced phase-shifting means, through the hazardous environment of HAB 12. This is an adventure fraught with carnivores of a Jurassic Age magnitude, and a terrain so deadly that turning back may be their only hope of survival. Note from the author: Don't be surprised by cliff-hanger endings. I'll do my best to keep Scrapyard Ship as well as the Tapped In series books coming so you wont have long to wait for the next book.
