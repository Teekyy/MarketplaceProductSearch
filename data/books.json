But I'm no barbarian\u2019s 'mail order bride,' even if he is super tall, muscular, and the chief of his tribe. He doesn\u2019t want a BBW blonde, either--it's written all over his chiseled face. He'll be truly angry if he ever learns what my 'crime' was. I am Torg. I have waited 34 rotations for a mate of my own. With this shipment, I was sure to get a fine, sturdy mate who'll bear me many daughters. Instead, I receive a small, curvy, pale-haired female who looks at me with anger and fear. It is only when we 'kiss' that I believe things may work out between us. But I'm hearing rumors that Starr and her shipmates are law-breakers. To survive, Dakonians must obey all laws \u2026 or be exiled into the frozen wasteland. Just when I have found her, will I have to banish my mate?",

But books won\u2019t protect him from Her Imperial Majesty Lionstone XIV, who just Outlawed and condemned Owen to death, without any explanation, reason, or warning. No wonder she\u2019s called the Iron Bitch. Now, on the run from Imperial starcruisers, shady mercenaries, and just about everyone else in the Empire, Owen\u2019s options are limited. Though the name Deathstalker still commands respect in certain quarters, out on the Rim, Owen is lucky he can cobble together a makeshift team of castoffs, including an ex-pirate, a cyborg, and a bounty hunter. But allies won\u2019t be enough to save him. If he\u2019s to live, Owen can either run forever...or take down the corrupt Empire. To do that, he\u2019ll need the fabled Darkvoid Device\u2014an artifact dating back to the first Deathstalker and perhaps the only weapon powerful enough to help this ragtag rebellion win. The time has come for Owen to finally embrace his Deathstalker heritage...and all the blood and death that go along with it. Deathstalker is the first book in New York Times bestselling author Simon R. Green\u2019s beloved space opera series.",

He fell in love with the adrenaline rush when he signed on as a Navy Seal right out of college, and he never got over the thrill of pitting himself against the impossible. Hope caught his eye the night she escaped her compound, but years of ignoring anything resembling a feeling made it easy to ignore the attraction\u2014until they\u2019re paired on a mission. Her intelligence and resourcefulness impress the hell out of him, but her half-naked body, exposed after an animal attack, forces him to face feelings he was certain he\u2019d buried for good.",

Bedivere X helps where he can, so when one lonely and scared computer, Jovanka, suicides and destroys half a planet, Bedivere takes the news hard. Then his close human friend Kemp is murdered and Bedivere disappears.

Has Bedivere really gone mad? Has he become one of the creatures that humans fear the most? Cat faces tough questions about the man she loves, while unravelling the mystery he has left behind. This book is part of the Interspace Origins science fiction romance series: 1.0: Faring Soul 2.0: Varkan Rise 3.0: Cat and Company 3.5: Interspace Origins (Series boxed set) A Science Fiction Romance Novel. ___ Praise for Varkan Rise: Smashwords Bestseller, Science Fiction Romance I resented having to stop reading to do my necessary chores ( ie. work ). I just love Bedivere and Catherine, and the love they have for each other, and it shows throughout the book. Varkan Rise had me worried and sad through much of the first half, because I was so concerned about the characters, what they were going through, and how in the heck they were going to get out of it. You come away from reading this book wishing it were real so that you could be traveling amongst the stars yourself. This is a fabulously dark story that keeps you guessing up until the very end. Loved it . The first book in this new series was so good it won an SFR Galaxy Award and this one is just as great Bedivere and Catherine are the cutest. Their devotion and love for each other shines through this novel. The world building is spot on, and the different worlds described are so vivid and lush, it's like you're right there. Another amazing chapter in this refreshing and captivating sci-fi series. Like all of this authors books you can't go wrong, Amazing Author, Amazing Read For five minutes there, my heart stopped and I cried a few tears. Yeah! I won't give it away but I was so sad. Before I knew I was at the end. Without putting the book down once. Like its predecessor, Faring Soul, I really enjoyed this book \u2013 I read it continuously, and finished it in a couple of days. Wow! What a story!!!! Bravo, on a riveting story with so much going on you have a hard time finding your feet! I fell a little in love with Bedivere and Catherine in the first book. I fell all the way in this one. The moment you start reading, you get sucked into the story and will not be able to put the book away that easily. I'm not a huge sci fi fan but how Tracy Cooper - Posey might have just turned me on to this genre. I especially love the twist at the end The logic of Bedivere is awesome!!",

        "description": "How can such a bright future be so full of darkness? Beautiful young Charity Freestone has it all: the love of a good man, the revelation of her remarkable identity, and her family reunited after their spectacular battle with the Sons of the Crystal Mind. However, at her moment of triumph Charity is tricked into joining the mysterious New Form Enterprise, whose harsh regime seems designed to break her. Before she can learn their strange purpose, a shocking betrayal brings unique and terrifying freedom. Cut off from its advanced technology, Charity is hunted through war-torn, subterranean Diamond City by an enemy who is always closer than she thinks. As she struggles to make sense of her inhumanly ruthless pursuers, Charity must confront her own complicity in the nightmare that engulfs her. And when she does, she discovers there are far worse places than the dreaded Outer Spheres. Book Two of Andrew Wallace\u2019s viscerally thrilling Diamond Roads science fiction series, The Outer Spheres takes extraordinary heroine Charity Freestone into even stranger and more disturbing territory. The novel threads bleeding-edge science through a fearsomely-wrought war story to explore the unimaginable outcomes of our most terrifying decisions. Blending the vast and eerie scale of Peter F Hamilton\u2019s The Reality Dysfunction with the originality and political insight of Anne Leckie\u2019s Ancilliary Justice, The Outer Spheres forges a unique vision of fear and wonder. Diamond Roads is fast becoming a whole new mythology, exploring the way things are against a wildly-imagined backdrop of how they might turn out. To see if Charity survives, and whether she can be truly free of her pursuers and her own demons, buy the book now. Praise for Diamond Roads: Andrew Wallace shows a real talent for world building in this well-written, fast-paced debut novel. From the first page, Diamond Roads is packed with sci-fi smarts. I\u2019m looking forward to reading more from this author \u2013 Anne Charnock, winner of the Clarke Award for Dreams Before the Start of Time & the BSFA Award for The Enclave Fast-paced, clever and beautifully written, Diamond Roads is a richly imagined dystopian thriller that introduces the latest in a long line of cool, kick-ass SF heroines. Charity Freestone combines the strength of Ripley with the wiles of Katniss and the vulnerability of Halo Jones.

        "description": "A scream of brakes, the splash into icy waters, a long descent into alkaline depths ... it was death. But Ned Vince lived again--a million years later!Excerpt \"See you in half an hour, Betty,\" said Ned Vince over the party telephone. \"We'll be out at the Silver Basket before ten-thirty....\"Ned Vince was eager for the company of the girl he loved. That was why he was in a hurry to get to the neighboring town of Hurley, where she lived. His old car rattled and roared as he swung it recklessly around Pit Bend.There was where Death tapped him on the shoulder. Another car leaped suddenly into view, its lights glaring blindingly past a high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic rock at the turn of the road.Dazzled, and befuddled by his own rash speed, Ned Vince had only swift young reflexes to rely on to avoid a fearful, telescoping collision. He flicked his wheel smoothly to the right; but the County Highway Commission hadn't yet tarred the traffic-loosened gravel at the Bend.Ned could scarcely have chosen a worse place to start sliding and spinning. His car hit the white-painted wooden rail sideways, crashed through, tumbled down a steep slope, struck a huge boulder, bounced up a little, and arced outward, falling as gracefully as a swan-diver toward the inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet beneath....Ned Vince was still dimly conscious when that black, quiet pool geysered around him in a mighty splash. He had only a dazing welt on his forehead, and a gag of terror in his throat.Movement was slower now, as he began to sink, trapped inside his wrecked car. Nothing that he could imagine could mean doom more certainly than this. The Pit was a tremendously deep pocket in the ground, spring-fed. The edges of that almost bottomless pool were caked with a rim of white--for the water, on which dead birds so often floated, was surcharged with alkali. As that heavy, natronous liquid rushed up through the openings and cracks beneath his feet, Ned Vince knew that his friends and his family would never see his body again, lost beyond recovery in this abyss.The car was deeply submerged. The light had blinked out on the dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute darkness. A flood rushed in at the shattered window. He clawed at the door, trying to open it, but it was jammed in the crash-bent frame, and he couldn't fight against the force of that incoming water. The welt, left by the blow he had received on his forehead, put a thickening mist over his brain, so that he could not think clearly. Presently, when he could no longer hold his breath, bitter liquid was sucked into his lungs.His last thoughts were those of a drowning man. The machine-shop he and his dad had had in Harwich. Betty Moore, with the smiling Irish eyes--like in the song. Betty and he had planned to go to the State University this Fall. They'd planned to be married sometime.... Goodbye, Betty ...The ripples that had ruffled the surface waters in the Pit, quieted again to glassy smoothness. The eternal stars shone calmly. The geologic Dakota hills, which might have seen the dinosaurs, still bulked along the highway. Time, the Brother of Death, and the Father of Change, seemed to wait....",

A detective on the edge of madness. The future of time travel at stake. From the author of The Warehouse . . . ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: NPR, Kirkus Reviews January Cole\u2019s job just got a whole lot harder. Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really easy. Nothing\u2019s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their \u201cflights\u201d to the past. Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion\u2014and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls. None of that compares to the corpse in room 526. The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January can see. On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology\u2014and the world\u2019s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims. January is sure the timing isn\u2019t a coincidence. Neither are those \u201caccidents\u201d that start stalking their bidders. There\u2019s a reason January can glimpse what others can\u2019t. A reason why she\u2019s the only one who can catch a killer who\u2019s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once. But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality\u2014and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not just the hotel\u2019s dark secrets but her own. At once a dazzlingly time-twisting murder mystery and a story about grief, memory, and what it means to\u2014literally\u2014come face-to-face with our ghosts, The Paradox Hotel is another unforgettable speculative thrill ride from acclaimed author Rob Hart.",

He takes a room at the inn, but refuses to socialize with anyone. He stays cooped up in his room all day and night, working with strange chemicals and apparatus. Suddenly, strange events begin to happen in the village. Mysterious burglaries and fires break out, culminating in a destructive rampage across the peaceful countryside. The stranger is the keeper of a terrible secret... The Invisible Man: A Grotesque Romance (to give the book its full title) by HG Wells was published in 1897. Written in novella form, this bizarre science fiction tale was first published in Pearson's Weekly as a serial and later compiled into a single book. Based on scientific theories of optics and physics, this story instantly caught the imagination of readers and has been regularly adapted to film, television and radio since it first made its appearance more than a hundred years ago. Herbert George Wells' writing career owes itself to an accident suffered in childhood. As an eight year old boy, he was once confined to bed with a broken leg. His father, a professional cricketer and failed businessman, regularly brought him books from the local library so that he could pass the time. His father's financial troubles compelled his mother to go to work as a lady's maid in a local mansion, while the children were put to work as apprentices with various local tradesmen. For Wells, this was one of the most unhappy, yet also the most profitable times in his life. The mansion where his mother worked had an enormous library where the child continued to read and educate himself. At eighteen, he went to work as a teacher in a residential school. His career flourished after that, and he won a scholarship to work under the great biologist, Thomas Huxley in London. He began writing science fiction stories in 1895 with the publication of The Time Machine, where he proposed the concept of selective time travel. Several other extremely popular Sci-Fi novels and short stories followed, interspersed with romantic stories, novels, ghost stories, film scripts, articles, satirical novels, historical and political treatises and non-fiction papers. Wells was an extremely prolific writer and continues to inspire generations of writers even today. The Invisible Man is a book that evokes great interest among readers of all ages and is an important landmark in the history of Sci-Fi writing. One dark and stormy night, a stranger arrives in West Sussex at a village inn. He is heavily clad in an overcoat and his face is wrapped in bandages.

        "description": "The Invisible Man is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse it. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction.This is a classic science-fiction book with over 100 pages of pure excitement and wonder. The Invisible Man may start out slowly, but once you pay close attention, the book becomes a spine-tingling thriller that will leave you breathless. It all starts when a mysterious stranger comes into the town of Iping, all wrapped up in bandages. He never takes off his glasses, bandages, or coat, and brings all sorts of strange chemicals in little bottles with him. He sits in his hotel room all day, working with the chemicals. No one knows what he's doing, but eventually, people get suspicious. Who is this disguised man? Is he a criminal in hiding? Or maybe he's horribly disfigured! All the same, they want to get a glimpse of this strange man's face. Just imagine their surprise when they find out that this man is invisible! I would definitely inspire anyone who likes a good hard read and science-fiction to read this fantastic novel",

It's said he raised the dead at the age of ten, stole the Philosopher's Stone in Vegas back in 1999, and survived the bloodsucking kiss of the Mosquito Queen.

His most highly regarded fictional work was the novel The Girl in the Golden Atom, which was a consolidation of a short story by the same name. For this novel Cummings combined the idea of Fitz James O'Brien's The Diamond Lens with H. G. Wells's The Time Machine. During the 1940s, Cummings anonymously scripted comic book stories for Timely Comics, the predecessor to Marvel Comics. He recycled the plot of The Girl in the Golden Atom for a two-part Captain America tale, Princess of the Atom (Captain America #25 & 26).",

The characters were great and you just didn't know who to trust in the conspiracy that was going on. ...Highly recommended series and anxious to read the next book. I love all of this author's books.

Such a great follow up to Legacy Code (which ended up on my Top Ten 2014 list) I love Autumn's writing style, she is so talented and takes you right there alongside the characters. This is a beautiful and unique story and I can't wait to read more!! \"In a story where I fell in love with the characters, it is easy to have your heart broken, have a smile on your face, or cry over a simple scene in the book. This is one series I would never stop reading, and admittedly, have read on more than one occasion!\" \"This series has me intrigued, it feels realistic, real and frightening at the same time. Humanity is alone in space in their fleet of ships and they have nowhere to go, they try to find a better earth, a new home.

Delving deeply into the work of major figures in the field - from Jack Kirby's cosmic superhero sagas and Philip K. Dick's futuristic head-trips to Alan Moore's sex magic and Whitley Strieber's communion with visitors - Kripal shows how creators turned to science fiction to convey the reality of the inexplicable and the paranormal they experienced in their lives. Expanded consciousness found its language in the metaphors of sci-fi - incredible powers, unprecedented mutations, time-loops and vast intergalactic intelligences - and the deeper influences of mythology and religion that these in turn drew from ; the wildly creative work that followed caught the imaginations of millions. Moving deftly from Cold War science and Fredric Wertham's anticomics crusade to gnostic revelation and alien abduction, Kripal spins out a hidden history of American culture, rich with mythical themes and shot through with an awareness that there are other realities far beyond our everyday understanding.\"--Jacket.",

        "author": "Autumn Kalquist",
        "description": "A brutal conspiracy threatens humanity's survival. Three hundred years ago, the Earth died, and the last humans fled. Beaten. Broken in more ways than one. But there was something they couldn't leave behind: The Legacy Code\u2014mangled genes that force them to abort half their unborn children. When Era and Dritan Corinth get placements on the safest ship in the fleet and win a chance to have a child, they feel lucky. Until the day Era's supposed to find out if her baby has the Defect, and the ship suffers a hull breach. An investigation uncovers new threats: Dangerous secrets. Lies. Treason. Era begins to question everything she\u2019s been taught about the fleet, their search for a new Earth, and the Defect. But the answers she seeks were never meant to be found... Legacy Code is a suspenseful and dark genetic engineering science fiction series that has earned five star reviews from fans of some of the best sci-fi and fantasy books like Hunger Games, Divergent, and Red Rising, and has been compared favorably to Wool, 1984, and the new Battlestar Galactica. \"Addictive sci-fi series. I haven't been this hooked on an author since Anne McCaffery's Killashandra series.\" ~ Marie Hall, New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Author What Readers are Saying: \u201cOne of the best books I've ever read, I can't wait to read the rest of the series.\u201d \u201cSpace, spaceships, planets, wormholes, dystopian, pregnancy, oh my! I thoroughly enjoyed Legacy Code. It was a quick read for me, as I found it hard to put down. After the first few chapters I was hooked & couldn't get enough\u2026 A great mix of SciFi & Dystopian! One of my top favourite reads for 2014.\u201d \u201cCompelling post-apocalyptic novel about survival: Wow. That was... astounding. I really enjoyed reading this\u2026 Living in space inside space ships? Holograms? Post-apocalypse? Heck, yeah!\u201d \u201cI cannot get enough of the Fractured Era series. It's the best sci-fi series I've read since The Post-Human series by David Simpson.\u201d \u201c\u2026An uncertain future has the colonists on edge, leading to acts of terrorism and assassination attempts on government officials\u2026 There are several intriguing elements at play, most significantly, the mystery of the Legacy Code and whether it holds the key to humanity's survival\u2026I'm looking forward to continuing the series to see where it goes from here.\u201d \u201cA couple of chapters in and I was already hooked! I ended up staying up til midnight (as a mother of a toddler this is a rare occasion) in order to finish it.\u201d \u201cI just finished this book...at 6:00 AM. This society crafted by Autumn Kalquist is fascinating. I can't even imagine how much time she spent carefully plotting every detail. Their existence feels so real and so frighteningly possible.\u201d \u201cIt kind of had an initial feel of Battlestar Galactica -- a civilization that has to abandon their planet and go in search of a new one. \u2026It had mystery, a bit of a thriller like aspect, humor, and a taste of romance.\" \u201cI both love and hate this book...but in a good way! Instantly I fell in love with the characters and storyline that Kalquist spun together\u2026This story is based in the future (almost a space opera / dystopian) where the populations of earth escaped to space to find a better world. ...we arrive in a distant future where civilization exists on space ships and they have to take decades before making jumps across space -similar in a way to what I imagine Stargate\u201d \u201cIt pulled me in faster than most books I have read and kept me on the edge of my seat through the end. I read it all in just a few hours.\" keywords: free science fiction books, free sci fi books, free science fiction, free sci fi, free space books, free space opera books, free ebooks, fiction books free, sci fi books free, science fiction books free, free mystery books, genetic engineering, space colony, space colonization, space opera, apocalypse, post-apocalyptic, generation ship, end of the world, space battle, space explorer",

Imagine, then, the excitement that Howard Carson, an amateur archeologist at best, experienced when in crossing the perimeter of an abandoned excavation site he felt the ground give way beneath him and found himself at the bottom of a shaft, which, judging from the DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging from an archaic doorknob, was clearly the entrance to a still-sealed burial chamber. Carson's incredible discoveries, including the remains of two bodies, one of then on a ceremonial bed facing an altar that appeared to be a means of communicating with the Gods and the other lying in a porcelain sarcophagus in the Inner Chamber, permitted him to piece together the whole fabric of that extraordinary civilization.",

A strange man discovers our nameless narrator selling popcorn at a decrepit small-town movie theater and offers her an odd and lucrative position: she will forget her job, her acquaintances, even her name, and move to Los Angeles, where she will become the body double of the famous and troubled celebrity Rosanna Feld. A nervous breakdown has forced Rosanna out of the public eye, and she needs a look-alike to take her place in the tabloid media circus of Hollywood. Overseen by Max, who hired her for the job, our narrator spends her days locked up in a small apartment in the hills watching hidden camera footage of Rosanna, wearing Rosanna's clothes, eating the food Rosanna likes, practicing her mannerisms, learning to become Rosanna in every way. But as she makes her public debut as Rosanna, alarming questions begin to arise. What really caused Rosanna's mental collapse? Will she ever return? And is Max truly her ally, or something more sinister?",

Hengyen was a grizzled military officer of some renown, and a passionate believer in his nation\u2019s ability to surmount any obstacle. But with the settlement\u2019s 3,000 mouths to feed and the scavengers having to travel further and further in search of food, Zhu ends up at his home village, where he is shocked to find survivors.

So far she's scored a rent free apartment in one of the nicest neighborhoods around by cat-sitting, and has a new job working at Untapped Books & Caf\u00e9. Hand-selling books and craft beers is easy for Odessa, but making new friends and learning how to ride the subway? Well, that might take her a little extra time. But things turn more sour than an IPA when the death of a fellow waitress goes viral, caught on camera in the background of a couple's flash-mob proposal video. Nothing about Bethany's death feels right to Odessa--neither her sudden departure mid-shift nor the clues that only Odessa seems to catch. As an up-and-coming YouTube star, Bethany had more than one viewer waiting for her to fall from grace. Determined to prove there's a killer on the loose, Odessa takes matters into her own hands. But can she pin down Bethany's killer before they take Odessa offline for good?",

        "author": "Gerald M. Kilby",
        "description": "How can a colony on Mars survive when the greatest danger on the planet is humanity itself? All contact is lost with the first human colony on Mars during a long and destructive sandstorm. Satellite imagery of the aftermath shows extensive damage to the facility, and the fifty-four colonists who called it home are presumed dead. Three years later, a new mission sets down on the planet surface to investigate what remains of the derelict site. But, it's not long before they realize the colony is not as lifeless as everyone thought. Someone is still alive -- hiding out somewhere. Yet, before they can find the elusive colonist a strange illness starts to affect the crew. Pressure now mounts on Biologist, Dr. Jann Malbec, to locate the source and find a way to fight it. However, as she investigates she begins to suspect a dark and deadly secret lurking within the facility. A secret that threatens not just the crew but the entire population of Earth. With limited resources and time running out, she must find some answers and find them fast. Because if she doesn't, none of them will be going home. About Colony One Mars: This is the first book in a Sci-Fi series set in a human colony on Mars. The science depicted is, for the most part, plausible. In other words, what's technically possible with either current technology or taking experimental research a step or two further. That said, you won't need a calculator or a slide-rule to enjoy the story.",

        "description": "Here are 25 stories of science fiction that push the envelope, by the biggest names in an emerging new crop of high-tech futuristic SF - including Charles Stross, Robert Reed, Alastair Reynolds, Peter Hamilton and Neal Asher. High-tech SF has made a significant comeback in the last decade, as bestselling authors successfully blend the super-science of 'hard science fiction' with real characters in an understandable scenario. It is perhaps a reflection of how technologically controlled our world is that readers increasingly look for science fiction that considers the fates of mankind as a result of increasing scientific domination. This anthology brings together the most extreme examples of the new high-tech, far-future science fiction, pushing the limits way beyond normal boundaries. The stories include: \"A Perpetual War Fought Within a Cosmic String\", \"A Weapon That Could Destroy the Universe\", \"A Machine That Detects Alternate Worlds and Creates a Choice of Christs\", \"An Immortal Dead Man Sent To The End of the Universe\", \"Murder in Virtual Reality\", \"A Spaceship So Large That There is An Entire Planetary System Within It\", and \"An Analytical Engine At The End of Time\", and \"Encountering the Untouchable.\"",

There was a time known as the Grind\u2014when Freeman's people lived as slaves to another race referred to simply as \"Master.\" They were property. But a civil rights movement emerged. Change seemed near, but the Masters refused to bend. Instead, they declared war. And lost. Now, the freed world is threatened by a virus, spread through bites, sweeping through the population. Those infected are propelled to violence, driven to disperse the virus. Uniquely suited to respond to this new threat, Freeman searches for a cure, but instead finds the source\u2014the Masters, intent on reclaiming the world. Freeman must fight for his life, for his friends and for the truth, which is far more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined. Robinson's lightning fast, cutting-edge novels have won over thriller, horror, science-fiction and action/adventure fans alike, and he has received high praise from peers like James Rollins, Jonathan Maberry, and Scott Sigler. XOM-B is a wildly inventive zombie novel with a high-tech twist that will keep readers guessing until the very last sentence.",

To control the past, they edited history. To control the future, they edited literature. LONDON, 1953. Thirteen years have passed since England surrendered to the Nazis and formed a Grand Alliance with Germany. It was forced to adopt many of its oppressive ideologies, one of which was the strict classification of women into hierarchical groups based on the perceived value they brought to society. Rose Ransom, a member of the privileged Geli class, remembers life from before the war but knows better than to let it show. She works for the Ministry of Culture, rewriting the classics of English literature to ensure there are no subversive thoughts that will give women any ideas. Outbreaks of insurgency have been seen across the country with graffiti made up of seditious lines from forbidden works by women painted on public buildings. Suspicion has fallen on Widowland, the run-down slums where childless women over fifty have been banished. Rose is given the dangerous task of infiltrating Widowland to find the source of the rebellion before the Leader arrives in England for the Coronation ceremony of King Edward VIII and Queen Wallis.

Most of the titles in this linked list of the free classic science fiction on Amazon were written before the \"Golden Age\" of science fiction, but influenced the authors who came later. I've included several early utopia/dystopia books, a popular subject in the late Victorian period. A few supernatural titles are included when the author also wrote other types of books. I didn't include fairy tales, and I made judgment calls on skipping science fiction/fantasy that was written for children and young adults, or just included a few samples from those authors.",

An army of bots is roaming the space station \u2014 hijacked by a terrorist inside BlumBot International. The bots share a hive mind that learns and adapts, making them the most deadly adversaries Jonah has ever faced.

To protect the colony, they must join forces with Tripp Van de Graaf \u2014 the cocky young executive with dimples for days. Tripp makes no effort to hide his attraction toward Maggie, and Jonah hates him instantly. But Tripp\u2019s company holds the key to defeating the bots: their human creator, Ziva Blum. When Maggie, Tripp, and Jonah learn that more humanoids are hibernating on Earth, they must race to stop a madman bent on destruction and save the world from a robot apocalypse. *** KEYWORDS: best science fiction, sci fi, adventure stories, space opera, military sci fi, space marine, military science fiction, space force, action and adventure, robots, AI, artificial intelligence evil robots, space station, space colony, colonization, free space opera, free military science fiction, free military sci fi, sci fi romance, spaceships, space travel, sci fi books that are free, read ebooks for free, stories to read online free, google books free to read, evil corporation, strong female lead, female protagonist, slow-burn romance, near-future technology",

        "author": "Mark Wayne McGinnis",
        "description": "\"Buckle up--this is another crazy ride!\" The Scrapyard Ship sci-fi \"cliff-hanger\" adventures continue with HAB 12, the second book in the series: Captain Jason Reynolds faces new challenges, not only on Earth but from the far side of the universe as well. The only way to stop the Craing this time will be to square off with them on their home turf. Jason's been informed that three powerful Craing warships, having similar technology as The Lilly, will soon be en route to Earth. The Alliance must destroy the Craing's wormhole means of distant space travel to avert Earth's total annihilation. Unfortunately, there's no way to reach the Craing worlds in time, at least not through conventional means. It's up to Jason and his hand-picked assault team to traverse, by advanced phase-shifting means, through the hazardous environment of HAB 12. This is an adventure fraught with carnivores of a Jurassic Age magnitude, and a terrain so deadly that turning back may be their only hope of survival. Note from the author: Don't be surprised by cliff-hanger endings. I'll do my best to keep Scrapyard Ship as well as the Tapped In series books coming so you wont have long to wait for the next book. Enjoy!",
