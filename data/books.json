        "description": "This analysis of cyberpunk science fiction written between 1981 and 2003 positions women's cyberpunk in the larger cultural discussion of feminist issues. It traces the origins of the genre, reviews the critical reactions and outlines the ways in which women's cyberpunk advances points of view that are specifically feminist. Novels are examined within their cultural contexts; their content is compared to broader controversies within contemporary feminism, and their themes are revealed as reflections of feminist discourse around the turn of the 21st century. Chapters cover topics such as globalization, virtual reality, cyborg culture, environmentalism, religion, motherhood and queer rights. Interviews with feminist cyberpunk authors are provided, revealing both their motivations for writing and their experiences with fans. The study treats feminist cyberpunk as a unique vehicle for examining contemporary women's issues and analyzes feminist science fiction as a complex source of political ideas.",

        "description": "This book traces developments in cyberpunk culture through a close engagement with the novels of the \u2018godfather of cyberpunk\u2019, William Gibson. Connecting his relational model of \u2018gestalt\u2019 psychology and imagery with that of the posthuman networked identities found in cyberpunk, the author draws out relations with key cultural moments of the last 40 years: postmodernism, posthumanism, 9/11, and the Anthropocene. By identifying cyberpunk ways of seeing with cyberpunk ways of being, the author shows how a visual style is crucial to cyberpunk on a philosophical level, as well as on an aesthetic level. Tracing a trajectory over Gibson\u2019s work that brings him from an emphasis on the visual that elevates the human over posthuman entities to a perspective based on touch, a truly posthuman understanding of humans as networked with their environments, she argues for connections between the visual and the posthuman that have not been explored elsewhere, and that have implications for future work in posthumanism and the arts. Proposing an innovative model of reading through gestalt psychology, this book will be of key importance to scholars and students in the medical humanities, posthumanism, literary and cultural studies, dystopian and utopian studies, and psychology.",

Set in a high-tech near future featuring an ascendant Muslim world and divided Western superpowers, this cult classic takes us into a world with mind- or mood-altering drugs for any purpose, brains enhanced by electronic hardware with plug-in memory additions and modules offering the wearer new personalities, and bodies shaped to perfection by surgery. Marid Audran, an unmodified and fairly honest street hustler, lives in a decadent Arab ghetto, the Budayeen, and holds on tight to his cherished independence. Then, against his best instincts, he becomes involved in a series of inexplicable murders. Some seem like routine assassinations, carried out with an old-fashioned handgun by a man wearing a plug-in James Bond persona; others, involving whores, feature prolonged torture and horrible mutilations. Soon the problem comes to the attention of Budayeen godfather Friedlander Bey\u2014who makes Audran an offer he can\u2019t refuse. Nominated for the Nebula and Hugo awards, the highest honors in the genre, When Gravity Fails, which introduced the cyberpunk Budayeen Cycle, is a pioneering work the Denver Post called \u201csuperior science fiction\u201d and Harlan Ellison described as \u201ccrazy as a spider on ice skates . . . plain old terrific.\u201d",

Here are twenty-four stories that span the illustrious career of the author who, along with William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, injected the word cyberpunk into the science fiction lexicon. These tales not only traverse galaxies and employ mind-boggling technologies, they also cut back across the centuries into a richly imagined past with style and a sharp satiric edge. Sterling\u2019s unparalleled imagination and courageous originality carry the reader into the future universe of the warring Shapers and Mechanists, rival sects of exiled humanity with radically opposed views of human augmentation. Several stories feature the questionable adventures of the footloose con man Leggy Starlitz in a somewhat-skewed and still-dangerous post\u2013Cold War world. Sterling explores the cyberpunk trope of technology gone wild and the resultant decline of civilization with appropriate gravity, while presenting parables of strangers stuck in very strange lands in a more whimsical vein. Whether chronicling an alien\u2019s encounter with Crusaders in disputed Palestine, depicting the discovery of the key to immortality in a nineteenth-century Times Square magic shop, or portraying bicycles and bad guys in a near-future Tennessee, Sterling\u2019s stories are smart, surprising, genre bending, bold, and outstanding, one and all.",

But will he be able solve the mystery without losing himself-and his friends-in the process? The road to hell is paved with good intentions, after all.

Beautiful young Charity Freestone has it all: the love of a good man, the revelation of her remarkable identity, and her family reunited after their spectacular battle with the Sons of the Crystal Mind. However, at her moment of triumph Charity is tricked into joining the mysterious New Form Enterprise, whose harsh regime seems designed to break her. Before she can learn their strange purpose, a shocking betrayal brings unique and terrifying freedom. Cut off from its advanced technology, Charity is hunted through war-torn, subterranean Diamond City by an enemy who is always closer than she thinks. As she struggles to make sense of her inhumanly ruthless pursuers, Charity must confront her own complicity in the nightmare that engulfs her. And when she does, she discovers there are far worse places than the dreaded Outer Spheres. Book Two of Andrew Wallace\u2019s viscerally thrilling Diamond Roads science fiction series, The Outer Spheres takes extraordinary heroine Charity Freestone into even stranger and more disturbing territory. The novel threads bleeding-edge science through a fearsomely-wrought war story to explore the unimaginable outcomes of our most terrifying decisions. Blending the vast and eerie scale of Peter F Hamilton\u2019s The Reality Dysfunction with the originality and political insight of Anne Leckie\u2019s Ancilliary Justice, The Outer Spheres forges a unique vision of fear and wonder. Diamond Roads is fast becoming a whole new mythology, exploring the way things are against a wildly-imagined backdrop of how they might turn out. To see if Charity survives, and whether she can be truly free of her pursuers and her own demons, buy the book now. Praise for Diamond Roads: Andrew Wallace shows a real talent for world building in this well-written, fast-paced debut novel. From the first page, Diamond Roads is packed with sci-fi smarts.

A detective on the edge of madness. The future of time travel at stake. From the author of The Warehouse . . . ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: NPR, Kirkus Reviews January Cole\u2019s job just got a whole lot harder. Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really easy. Nothing\u2019s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their \u201cflights\u201d to the past. Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion\u2014and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls. None of that compares to the corpse in room 526. The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January can see. On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology\u2014and the world\u2019s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims. January is sure the timing isn\u2019t a coincidence. Neither are those \u201caccidents\u201d that start stalking their bidders. There\u2019s a reason January can glimpse what others can\u2019t. A reason why she\u2019s the only one who can catch a killer who\u2019s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once. But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality\u2014and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not just the hotel\u2019s dark secrets but her own. At once a dazzlingly time-twisting murder mystery and a story about grief, memory, and what it means to\u2014literally\u2014come face-to-face with our ghosts, The Paradox Hotel is another unforgettable speculative thrill ride from acclaimed author Rob Hart.",

It's said he raised the dead at the age of ten, stole the Philosopher's Stone in Vegas back in 1999, and survived the bloodsucking kiss of the Mosquito Queen. Wise in the hidden ways of the night, he's also a cynical bastard who stopped thinking of himself as the good guy a long time ago. Now a promise to a dying friend has Ballard on the trail of an escaped Serbian war criminal with friends in both high and low places\u2014and a sinister history of blood sacrifices. Ballard is hell-bent on making Dusan Slorzack pay for his numerous atrocities, but Slorzack seems to have literally dropped off the face of the Earth, beyond the reach of his enemies, the Illuminati, and maybe even the Devil himself. To find Slorzack, Ballard must follow a winding, treacherous path that stretches from Wall Street and Washington, D.C. to backwoods hollows and truckstops, while risking what's left of his very soul . . . .",

        "description": "One dark and stormy night, a stranger arrives in West Sussex at a village inn. He is heavily clad in an overcoat and his face is wrapped in bandages. He takes a room at the inn, but refuses to socialize with anyone. He stays cooped up in his room all day and night, working with strange chemicals and apparatus. Suddenly, strange events begin to happen in the village. Mysterious burglaries and fires break out, culminating in a destructive rampage across the peaceful countryside. The stranger is the keeper of a terrible secret... The Invisible Man: A Grotesque Romance (to give the book its full title) by HG Wells was published in 1897. Written in novella form, this bizarre science fiction tale was first published in Pearson's Weekly as a serial and later compiled into a single book. Based on scientific theories of optics and physics, this story instantly caught the imagination of readers and has been regularly adapted to film, television and radio since it first made its appearance more than a hundred years ago. Herbert George Wells' writing career owes itself to an accident suffered in childhood. As an eight year old boy, he was once confined to bed with a broken leg. His father, a professional cricketer and failed businessman, regularly brought him books from the local library so that he could pass the time. His father's financial troubles compelled his mother to go to work as a lady's maid in a local mansion, while the children were put to work as apprentices with various local tradesmen. For Wells, this was one of the most unhappy, yet also the most profitable times in his life. The mansion where his mother worked had an enormous library where the child continued to read and educate himself. At eighteen, he went to work as a teacher in a residential school. His career flourished after that, and he won a scholarship to work under the great biologist, Thomas Huxley in London. He began writing science fiction stories in 1895 with the publication of The Time Machine, where he proposed the concept of selective time travel. Several other extremely popular Sci-Fi novels and short stories followed, interspersed with romantic stories, novels, ghost stories, film scripts, articles, satirical novels, historical and political treatises and non-fiction papers. Wells was an extremely prolific writer and continues to inspire generations of writers even today. The Invisible Man is a book that evokes great interest among readers of all ages and is an important landmark in the history of Sci-Fi writing.

Ray Cummings is an American author of science fiction literature and comic books. Cummings is identified as one of the \"founding fathers\" of the science fiction genre. His most highly regarded fictional work was the novel The Girl in the Golden Atom, which was a consolidation of a short story by the same name. For this novel Cummings combined the idea of Fitz James O'Brien's The Diamond Lens with H. G. Wells's The Time Machine. During the 1940s, Cummings anonymously scripted comic book stories for Timely Comics, the predecessor to Marvel Comics. He recycled the plot of The Girl in the Golden Atom for a two-part Captain America tale, Princess of the Atom (Captain America #25 & 26).",

What readers are saying: If you like mysteries and/or sci-fi you will love this book!!! \"This is a very good story that has your heart pounding as you turn the pages. Intrigue, nefarious plots, twists and turns around every corner - great series, even if you're not a fan of science fiction.\" \"From the moment I read the first paragraph of Paragon, up until the last sentence, I was enthralled. Non-stop, on edge, exciting action. I honestly couldn't put a fault on this one, I loved all of it, including the song! The Fractured Era series is still up there amongst my favourite novels of the year.\" \"Full of questions, traitors galore, secrets & suspicions. You can't even trust your own family in this world!\" Phenomenal...that's the best word to describe it. Autumn Kalquist manages to weave a tale that is jam packed with suspense and whodunit plots. Just loved it with it many twists and turns that keeps you on your toes. The characters were great and you just didn't know who to trust in the conspiracy that was going on. ...Highly recommended series and anxious to read the next book. I love all of this author's books. I have read many post-apocalyptic and dystopian tales and this is different from all the rest. She always keeps me guessing. My only complaint is she doesn\u2019t write them fast enough!! I believe this is the first 5 star rating I've ever given. LOVED IT! Such a great follow up to Legacy Code (which ended up on my Top Ten 2014 list) I love Autumn's writing style, she is so talented and takes you right there alongside the characters. This is a beautiful and unique story and I can't wait to read more!! \"In a story where I fell in love with the characters, it is easy to have your heart broken, have a smile on your face, or cry over a simple scene in the book. This is one series I would never stop reading, and admittedly, have read on more than one occasion!\" \"This series has me intrigued, it feels realistic, real and frightening at the same time. Humanity is alone in space in their fleet of ships and they have nowhere to go, they try to find a better earth, a new home. I want to know if they ever find it.\" keywords: science fiction best sellers, top sci-fi books, top science fiction books, best sci-fi fantasy books, genetic engineering science fiction series, best science fiction novels, genetic engineering, space colony, space colonization, space opera, apocalypse, post-apocalyptic, generation ship, end of the world, space battle, space explorer",

Delving deeply into the work of major figures in the field - from Jack Kirby's cosmic superhero sagas and Philip K. Dick's futuristic head-trips to Alan Moore's sex magic and Whitley Strieber's communion with visitors - Kripal shows how creators turned to science fiction to convey the reality of the inexplicable and the paranormal they experienced in their lives. Expanded consciousness found its language in the metaphors of sci-fi - incredible powers, unprecedented mutations, time-loops and vast intergalactic intelligences - and the deeper influences of mythology and religion that these in turn drew from ; the wildly creative work that followed caught the imaginations of millions. Moving deftly from Cold War science and Fredric Wertham's anticomics crusade to gnostic revelation and alien abduction, Kripal spins out a hidden history of American culture, rich with mythical themes and shot through with an awareness that there are other realities far beyond our everyday understanding.\"--Jacket.",

Hand-selling books and craft beers is easy for Odessa, but making new friends and learning how to ride the subway? Well, that might take her a little extra time.

As an up-and-coming YouTube star, Bethany had more than one viewer waiting for her to fall from grace. Determined to prove there's a killer on the loose, Odessa takes matters into her own hands.

        "description": "A dark, glittering debut novel echoing Hitchcock's Vertigo, The Body Double is the suspenseful story of a young woman who is recruited by a stranger to give up her old life and identity to impersonate a reclusive Hollywood star. A strange man discovers our nameless narrator selling popcorn at a decrepit small-town movie theater and offers her an odd and lucrative position: she will forget her job, her acquaintances, even her name, and move to Los Angeles, where she will become the body double of the famous and troubled celebrity Rosanna Feld. A nervous breakdown has forced Rosanna out of the public eye, and she needs a look-alike to take her place in the tabloid media circus of Hollywood. Overseen by Max, who hired her for the job, our narrator spends her days locked up in a small apartment in the hills watching hidden camera footage of Rosanna, wearing Rosanna's clothes, eating the food Rosanna likes, practicing her mannerisms, learning to become Rosanna in every way. But as she makes her public debut as Rosanna, alarming questions begin to arise. What really caused Rosanna's mental collapse? Will she ever return? And is Max truly her ally, or something more sinister?",

        "description": "In this riveting, \u201cgory, and action-packed\u201d (Jonathan Maberry) survival thriller, set in the expansive world of Robert Kirkman\u2019s The Walking Dead series, three people from different walks of life in China must join forces against the typhoon of undead as chaos sweeps over Asia. In the aftermath of the zombie virus outbreak, what remains of the Chinese government has estimated that one billion walkers (called jiangshi) are currently roaming through the country. Across this dramatic landscape, large groups of survivors have clustered together for safety in villages and towns that have been built vertically as a means of protection against the unceasing wave of jiangshi. Before this devastation, Zhu was one of the millions of poor farmers who left their rural roots for the promise of consistent employment in one of China\u2019s booming factory towns. Elena was an American teaching English in China while on a gap year before beginning law school. Hengyen was a grizzled military officer of some renown, and a passionate believer in his nation\u2019s ability to surmount any obstacle. But with the settlement\u2019s 3,000 mouths to feed and the scavengers having to travel further and further in search of food, Zhu ends up at his home village, where he is shocked to find survivors. Does he force them to join the settlement or keep their existence a secret? Meanwhile, Hengyen is tasked with the impossible: fortifying the Beacon against a 100,000-strong \u201ctyphoon\u201d of walkers header their way. Even though he realizes that the Beacon hardly stands a chance, Hengyen is a believer and will stand with his compatriots to the very last, bringing him into conflict with Zhu, who intends to flee the path of the typhoon and make for the safety of China\u2019s dramatic mountain ranges before it\u2019s too late. Given \u201ctwo decaying thumbs up,\u201d (Jonathan Mayberry, author of Rot & Ruin), this book is sure to get your heart racing and leave you wanting more!",

        "description": "Here are 25 stories of science fiction that push the envelope, by the biggest names in an emerging new crop of high-tech futuristic SF - including Charles Stross, Robert Reed, Alastair Reynolds, Peter Hamilton and Neal Asher. High-tech SF has made a significant comeback in the last decade, as bestselling authors successfully blend the super-science of 'hard science fiction' with real characters in an understandable scenario. It is perhaps a reflection of how technologically controlled our world is that readers increasingly look for science fiction that considers the fates of mankind as a result of increasing scientific domination. This anthology brings together the most extreme examples of the new high-tech, far-future science fiction, pushing the limits way beyond normal boundaries. The stories include: \"A Perpetual War Fought Within a Cosmic String\", \"A Weapon That Could Destroy the Universe\", \"A Machine That Detects Alternate Worlds and Creates a Choice of Christs\", \"An Immortal Dead Man Sent To The End of the Universe\", \"Murder in Virtual Reality\", \"A Spaceship So Large That There is An Entire Planetary System Within It\", and \"An Analytical Engine At The End of Time\", and \"Encountering the Untouchable.\"",

Atlas is what took his mother away; what made his father lose hope; what led Alejandro Casales, leader of the religious cult known as the Circle, to his door. And now, on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of Atlas\u2019s departure, it\u2019s got something to do why Casales was found dead in his hotel room\u2014and why Carlos is the man in charge of the investigation. To figure out who killed one of the most powerful men on Earth, Carlos is supposed to put aside his personal history. But the deeper he delves into the case, the more he realizes that escaping the past is not so easy. There\u2019s more to Casales\u2019s death than meets the eye, and something much more sinister to the legacy of Atlas than anyone realizes...",

        "author": "Gerald M. Kilby",
        "description": "How can a colony on Mars survive when the greatest danger on the planet is humanity itself? All contact is lost with the first human colony on Mars during a long and destructive sandstorm. Satellite imagery of the aftermath shows extensive damage to the facility, and the fifty-four colonists who called it home are presumed dead. Three years later, a new mission sets down on the planet surface to investigate what remains of the derelict site. But, it's not long before they realize the colony is not as lifeless as everyone thought. Someone is still alive -- hiding out somewhere. Yet, before they can find the elusive colonist a strange illness starts to affect the crew. Pressure now mounts on Biologist, Dr. Jann Malbec, to locate the source and find a way to fight it. However, as she investigates she begins to suspect a dark and deadly secret lurking within the facility. A secret that threatens not just the crew but the entire population of Earth. With limited resources and time running out, she must find some answers and find them fast. Because if she doesn't, none of them will be going home. About Colony One Mars: This is the first book in a Sci-Fi series set in a human colony on Mars. The science depicted is, for the most part, plausible. In other words, what's technically possible with either current technology or taking experimental research a step or two further. That said, you won't need a calculator or a slide-rule to enjoy the story.",

Doctor Silas Coade wakes from disturbing dreams, on the steamship Demeter, in pursuit of an extraordinary find almost too incredible and too strange to believe, secreted within a lagoon in the icy inlets of Patagonia. But as they come in sight of their prize he and the crew see they are not the first to come so far: there is a wreck ahead, and whatever ruined it may threaten them as well-- Shaking off his nightmares, Doctor Silas Coade joins his fellow exploders on the deck of the zeppelin Demeter and realises something has already gone dangerously wrong with their mission. If any of them are to survive, then he will have to take the exploration - and their lives - into his own hands . . .",

But there was something they couldn't leave behind: The Legacy Code\u2014mangled genes that force them to abort half their unborn children. When Era and Dritan Corinth get placements on the safest ship in the fleet and win a chance to have a child, they feel lucky. Until the day Era's supposed to find out if her baby has the Defect, and the ship suffers a hull breach. An investigation uncovers new threats: Dangerous secrets. Lies. Treason. Era begins to question everything she\u2019s been taught about the fleet, their search for a new Earth, and the Defect. But the answers she seeks were never meant to be found... Legacy Code is a suspenseful and dark genetic engineering science fiction series that has earned five star reviews from fans of some of the best sci-fi and fantasy books like Hunger Games, Divergent, and Red Rising, and has been compared favorably to Wool, 1984, and the new Battlestar Galactica. \"Addictive sci-fi series. I haven't been this hooked on an author since Anne McCaffery's Killashandra series.\" ~ Marie Hall, New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Author What Readers are Saying: \u201cOne of the best books I've ever read, I can't wait to read the rest of the series.\u201d \u201cSpace, spaceships, planets, wormholes, dystopian, pregnancy, oh my! I thoroughly enjoyed Legacy Code. It was a quick read for me, as I found it hard to put down. After the first few chapters I was hooked & couldn't get enough\u2026 A great mix of SciFi & Dystopian! One of my top favourite reads for 2014.\u201d \u201cCompelling post-apocalyptic novel about survival: Wow. That was... astounding. I really enjoyed reading this\u2026 Living in space inside space ships? Holograms? Post-apocalypse? Heck, yeah!\u201d \u201cI cannot get enough of the Fractured Era series. It's the best sci-fi series I've read since The Post-Human series by David Simpson.\u201d \u201c\u2026An uncertain future has the colonists on edge, leading to acts of terrorism and assassination attempts on government officials\u2026 There are several intriguing elements at play, most significantly, the mystery of the Legacy Code and whether it holds the key to humanity's survival\u2026I'm looking forward to continuing the series to see where it goes from here.\u201d \u201cA couple of chapters in and I was already hooked! I ended up staying up til midnight (as a mother of a toddler this is a rare occasion) in order to finish it.\u201d \u201cI just finished this book...at 6:00 AM. This society crafted by Autumn Kalquist is fascinating. I can't even imagine how much time she spent carefully plotting every detail. Their existence feels so real and so frighteningly possible.\u201d \u201cIt kind of had an initial feel of Battlestar Galactica -- a civilization that has to abandon their planet and go in search of a new one. \u2026It had mystery, a bit of a thriller like aspect, humor, and a taste of romance.\" \u201cI both love and hate this book...but in a good way! Instantly I fell in love with the characters and storyline that Kalquist spun together\u2026This story is based in the future (almost a space opera / dystopian) where the populations of earth escaped to space to find a better world. ...we arrive in a distant future where civilization exists on space ships and they have to take decades before making jumps across space -similar in a way to what I imagine Stargate\u201d \u201cIt pulled me in faster than most books I have read and kept me on the edge of my seat through the end.

        "description": "Freeman is a genius with an uncommon mixture of memory, intelligence and creativity. He lives in a worldwide utopia, but it was not always so. There was a time known as the Grind\u2014when Freeman's people lived as slaves to another race referred to simply as \"Master.\" They were property. But a civil rights movement emerged. Change seemed near, but the Masters refused to bend. Instead, they declared war. And lost. Now, the freed world is threatened by a virus, spread through bites, sweeping through the population. Those infected are propelled to violence, driven to disperse the virus. Uniquely suited to respond to this new threat, Freeman searches for a cure, but instead finds the source\u2014the Masters, intent on reclaiming the world. Freeman must fight for his life, for his friends and for the truth, which is far more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined. Robinson's lightning fast, cutting-edge novels have won over thriller, horror, science-fiction and action/adventure fans alike, and he has received high praise from peers like James Rollins, Jonathan Maberry, and Scott Sigler. XOM-B is a wildly inventive zombie novel with a high-tech twist that will keep readers guessing until the very last sentence.",

Amazon has changed their other Kindle reader software (PaperWhite, eInk and Touch) so those users must use this eBook in Amazon's downloadable Cloud Reader (read.amazon.com) on a PC or laptop to select and send the free classics to their Kindle. iPad users must use the Cloud Reader from \"Manage Your Kindle\" to use the download links, see \"From The Author\" below. Amazon Prime members are welcome to use their free monthly borrow to get this list and download hundreds of the free classics for future reading. This linked list of over 350 free science fiction stories and novels in Amazon's permanent collection was recently updated with hundreds of works from famous science fiction writers who wrote in the 1950's and 1960's and apparently forgot to extend their copyright protection. For the more recent authors SciFi fans will be familiar with, I just list the links (arranged by author) that will take you to their titles in the Kindle store for free download. For the earlier writers, I usually include a one or two line summary of their books. I thought I read all the classic SciFi twenty years ago, but I found a couple dozen authors I'd never heard of while researching Amazon's free collection. Most of the titles in this linked list of the free classic science fiction on Amazon were written before the \"Golden Age\" of science fiction, but influenced the authors who came later. I've included several early utopia/dystopia books, a popular subject in the late Victorian period. A few supernatural titles are included when the author also wrote other types of books. I didn't include fairy tales, and I made judgment calls on skipping science fiction/fantasy that was written for children and young adults, or just included a few samples from those authors.",

Dick Award Nominee \"A compulsive, terrifying read.\"\u2014Kate Quinn, New York Times bestselling author of The Rose Code For readers of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale comes a thrilling feminist dystopian novel set in an alternative history that terrifyingly imagines what a British alliance with Germany would look like if the Nazis had won WWII. To control the past, they edited history. To control the future, they edited literature. LONDON, 1953. Thirteen years have passed since England surrendered to the Nazis and formed a Grand Alliance with Germany. It was forced to adopt many of its oppressive ideologies, one of which was the strict classification of women into hierarchical groups based on the perceived value they brought to society. Rose Ransom, a member of the privileged Geli class, remembers life from before the war but knows better than to let it show. She works for the Ministry of Culture, rewriting the classics of English literature to ensure there are no subversive thoughts that will give women any ideas. Outbreaks of insurgency have been seen across the country with graffiti made up of seditious lines from forbidden works by women painted on public buildings. Suspicion has fallen on Widowland, the run-down slums where childless women over fifty have been banished. Rose is given the dangerous task of infiltrating Widowland to find the source of the rebellion before the Leader arrives in England for the Coronation ceremony of King Edward VIII and Queen Wallis. Will Rose follow her instructions and uncover the criminals? Or will she fight for what she knows in her heart is right?

Just as Tanner begins basic training, the government ramps up its forces to confront a band of rowdy raiders who are wreaking havoc in the void. Led by complex and charismatic Captain Casey, the outlaws love a little murder and mayhem, but they are also democratic, egalitarian, and devoted to freeing each new recruit from debt and corporate oppression.

Landover was a genuine magic kingdom, with fairy folk and wizardry, just as the advertisement has promised. But after he purchased it, Ben Holiday learned that there were a few details the ad had failed to mention. The kingdom was in ruin. The Barons refused to recognize a king, and the peasants were without hope. A dragon was laying waste the countryside, while an evil witch plotted to destroy everything. Ben's only followers were the incompetent Court Magician; Abernathy, the talking dog who served as Court Scribe; and the lovely Willow\u2014but she had a habit of putting down roots in the moonlight and turning into a tree. The Paladin, legendary champion of the Kings of Landover, seemed to be only a myth and an empty suit of armor. To put the final touch on the whole affair, Ben soon learned that the Iron Mark, terrible lord of the demons, had challenged all prospective Kings of Landover to duel to the death\u2014a duel which no human could hope to win. The task of proving his right to be King seemed hopeless. But Ben Holiday was stubborn. . . .",

        "description": "Hundreds of millions of years ago, two near-omnipotent alien races encountered each other, beginning a conflict that will shape the history of the entire universe. The benevolent Arisians covertly influence humanity, hoping to create a people capable of one day defeating the vile Eddorians, who are waging their own campaign for the fate of civilization on Earth. This sets the stage for a clash between the Triplanetary League of the inner solar system, the enigmatic pirate-scientist Roger, and the Nevians, interlopers whose first appearance wreaks havoc among the other parties. Triplanetary is the first of Edward E. \u201cDoc\u201d Smith\u2019s Lensman series, an early and influential entry in the space opera genre. Originally serialized in Amazing Stories in 1934 as a stand-alone story, Triplanetary was collected in book form in 1948 with six new chapters and numerous additions, changing the story to be a prequel to the rest of the Lensman series.",

A Hugo Award-winning Novel! \u201cVinge is one of the best visionary writers of SF today.\u201d-David Brin Thousands of years in the future, humanity is no longer alone in a universe where a mind's potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures, and technology, can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these \"regions of thought,\" but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence. Fleeing this galactic threat, Ravna crash lands on a strange world with a ship-hold full of cryogenically frozen children, the only survivors from a destroyed space-lab. They are taken captive by the Tines, an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power struggle.

        "description": "\"Buckle up--this is another crazy ride!\" The Scrapyard Ship sci-fi \"cliff-hanger\" adventures continue with HAB 12, the second book in the series: Captain Jason Reynolds faces new challenges, not only on Earth but from the far side of the universe as well. The only way to stop the Craing this time will be to square off with them on their home turf. Jason's been informed that three powerful Craing warships, having similar technology as The Lilly, will soon be en route to Earth. The Alliance must destroy the Craing's wormhole means of distant space travel to avert Earth's total annihilation. Unfortunately, there's no way to reach the Craing worlds in time, at least not through conventional means. It's up to Jason and his hand-picked assault team to traverse, by advanced phase-shifting means, through the hazardous environment of HAB 12. This is an adventure fraught with carnivores of a Jurassic Age magnitude, and a terrain so deadly that turning back may be their only hope of survival. Note from the author: Don't be surprised by cliff-hanger endings. I'll do my best to keep Scrapyard Ship as well as the Tapped In series books coming so you wont have long to wait for the next book. Enjoy!",
