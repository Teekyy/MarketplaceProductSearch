        "author": "Peter F. Hamilton",
        "description": "NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY New York Times bestselling author Peter F. Hamilton\u2019s riveting new thriller combines the nail-biting suspense of a serial-killer investigation with clear-eyed scientific and social extrapolation to create a future that seems not merely plausible but inevitable. A century from now, thanks to a technology allowing instantaneous travel across light-years, humanity has solved its energy shortages, cleaned up the environment, and created far-flung colony worlds. The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family\u2014composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another, the original three clone \u201cbrothers\u201d have gone their separate ways, and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies. Or maybe not so friendly. At least that\u2019s what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who\u2019d like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it, whether he solves the crime or not, he\u2019ll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid\u2019s case is about to take an unexpected turn: because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra, where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood. The convicted slayer, Angela Tramelo, has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime. Problem is, Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster. Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world\u2019s political and economic elite . . . all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again. And on St. Libra, Angela, newly released from prison, joins a mission to hunt down the elusive alien, only to learn that the line between hunter and hunted is a thin one.

Trillionaire space magnate John Rook leads a desperate escape to the nascent Mars colony. But when the atomic auroras fade and those left on Earth find themselves struggling against more than just fallout and other survivors, the lucky ones who got away fear they made a one-way trip. Centuries later in the now-sprawling Martian metropolis, a transformed species tries to cope with life on an alien world starved of flora and fauna. Their ancestors' actions and the distant neon blue flicker of the rewilded Earth haunt those confined to the rusty red planet. None feel it more than John's daughter, the eminent Gloria Rook. Her mind and body are sharper than ever, but no cybernetic implant or designer chemical can dull the longing. An impossible signal hints there may be a way to return to Earth and reveals another more nefarious secret. It might just be Gloria and the Martians' chance to finally go home, or destroy everything they've built.",

        "title": "Neoliberalism and Cyberpunk Science Fiction",
        "author": "Caroline Alphin",
        "description": "Caroline Alphin presents an original exploration of biopolitics by examining it through the lens of cyberpunk science fiction. Comprised of five chapters, Neoliberalism and Cyberpunk Science Fiction is guided by four central themes: biopolitics, intensification, resilience, and accelerationism. The first chapters examine the political possibilities of cyberpunk as a genre of science fiction and introduce one kind of neoliberal subject, the self-monitoring cyborg. These are individuals who join fitness/health tracking devices and applications to their body to \"self-cultivate\". Here, Alphin presents concrete examples of how fitness trackers are a strategy of neoliberal governmentality under the guise of self-cultivation. Moving away from Foucault\u2019s biopolitics to themes of intensity and resilience, Alphin draws largely from William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer, Neal Stephenson\u2019s Snow Crash, Richard K. Morgan\u2019s Altered Carbon, along with the film Blade Runner to problematize notions of neoliberal resilience. Alphin returns to biopolitics, intensity, and resilience, connecting these themes to accelerationism as she engages with biohacker discourses. Here she argues that a biohacker is, in part, an intensification of the self-monitoring cyborg and accelerationism is in the end another form of resilience. Neoliberalism and Cyberpunk Science Fiction is an invaluable resource for those interested in security studies, political sociology, biopolitics, critical IR theory, political theory, cultural studies, and literary theory.",

Time to stop flipping the channel. These sixteen extreme stories reveal a government ninja routed by a bicycle repairman, the inventor of digitized paper hijacked by his college crush, a dead boy trapped in a warped storybook paradise, and the queen of England attacked with the deadliest of forbidden technology: a working modem. You\u2019ll meet Manfred Macx, renegade meme-broker, Red Sonja, virtual reality sex-goddess, and Felix, humble sys-admin and post-apocalyptic hero. Editors James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel (Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology) have united cyberpunk visionaries William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, and Pat Cadigan with the new post-cyberpunk vanguard, including Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross, and Jonathan Lethem. Including a canon-establishing introduction and excerpts from a hotly contested online debate, Rewired is the first anthology to define and capture the crackling excitement of the post-cyberpunks. From the grittiness of Mirrorshades to the Singularity and beyond, it\u2019s time to revive the revolution.",

For Sarah, a twenty-year-old college dropout, it's an early morning serving donuts and coffee to commuters at North Station. Fate brings them together at the scene of a bank robbery, which they foil together, along with a mysterious and wealthy woman named Helen, who offers to reward them for their bravery. But before they can reach Helen's penthouse, they are assaulted by men and women from all walks of life, including police officers.

He survived the nuclear fallout in St. Petersburg and hid in the London Metrozone -- the last city in England. He's lived this long because he's a man of rules and logic. For example, getting involved = a bad idea. But when he stumbles into a kidnapping in progress, he acts without even thinking. Before he can stop himself, he's saved the daughter of the most dangerous man in London. And clearly saving the girl = getting involved. Now, the equation of Petrovitch's life is looking increasingly complex. Russian mobsters + Yakuza + something called the New Machine Jihad = one dead Petrovitch. But Petrovitch has a plan -- he always has a plan -- he's just not sure it's a good one.",

Because that would be ridiculous. It wasn't the \"sex talk\" he expected. Phillip Sallinger's dad has told him he's a custodian--a guardian--and his genetically inherited power is telekinesis. He'll learn to move objects with his mind. Excited to begin superhero high school until he discovers he's assigned to a \"special ed\" class for disabled empowered kids, he suddenly feels like an outsider. Bullied, threatened, and betrayed, Phillip struggles, even as he and his friends--calling themselves the Ables--find ways to maximize their powers to overcome their disabilities, and are the first to identify the growing evil threatening humanity. As vital custodians disappear and the custodian leadership is mired in indecision, a mysterious and powerful figure taunts Phillip, and the enemy is poised to strike. But what if the next \"one who does all,\" the multi-gifted custodian predicted to come, is one of the Ables?",

        "description": "Shortlisted, 2024 SHARP Book History Book Prize, Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing In the late 1950s, Random House editor Jason Epstein would talk jazz with Ralph Ellison or chat with Andy Warhol while pouring drinks in his office. By the 1970s, editors were poring over profit-and-loss statements. The electronics company RCA bought Random House in 1965, and then other large corporations purchased other formerly independent publishers. As multinational conglomerates consolidated the industry, the business of literature\u2014and literature itself\u2014transformed. Dan Sinykin explores how changes in the publishing industry have affected fiction, literary form, and what it means to be an author. Giving an inside look at the industry\u2019s daily routines, personal dramas, and institutional crises, he reveals how conglomeration has shaped what kinds of books and writers are published. Sinykin examines four different sectors of the publishing industry: mass-market books by brand-name authors like Danielle Steel; trade publishers that encouraged genre elements in literary fiction; nonprofits such as Graywolf that aspired to protect literature from market pressures; and the distinctive niche of employee-owned W. W. Norton. He emphasizes how women and people of color navigated shifts in publishing, arguing that writers such as Toni Morrison allegorized their experiences in their fiction. Big Fiction features dazzling readings of a vast range of novelists\u2014including E. L. Doctorow, Judith Krantz, Renata Adler, Stephen King, Joan Didion, Cormac McCarthy, Chuck Palahniuk, Patrick O\u2019Brian, and Walter Mosley\u2014as well as vivid portraits of industry figures. Written in gripping and lively prose, this deeply original book recasts the past six decades of American fiction.",

All contact is lost with the first human colony on Mars during a long and destructive sandstorm. Satellite imagery of the aftermath shows extensive damage to the facility, and the fifty-four colonists who called it home are presumed dead. Three years later, a new mission sets down on the planet surface to investigate what remains of the derelict site. But, it's not long before they realize the colony is not as lifeless as everyone thought. Someone is still alive -- hiding out somewhere. Yet, before they can find the elusive colonist a strange illness starts to affect the crew. Pressure now mounts on Biologist, Dr. Jann Malbec, to locate the source and find a way to fight it. However, as she investigates she begins to suspect a dark and deadly secret lurking within the facility. A secret that threatens not just the crew but the entire population of Earth. With limited resources and time running out, she must find some answers and find them fast. Because if she doesn't, none of them will be going home. About Colony One Mars: This is the first book in a Sci-Fi series set in a human colony on Mars. The science depicted is, for the most part, plausible. In other words, what's technically possible with either current technology or taking experimental research a step or two further. That said, you won't need a calculator or a slide-rule to enjoy the story.",

Nobody knew why it came. Even so, for two-bit (and antisocial) reporter Andy Pointer, the appearance in his city of a man made of moving stone meant the scoop of a lifetime. He would soon learn that The Stone Man was much more - and much worse - than that. This is Andy's account of everything that came afterwards, and the people that were lost along the way; of the terrible price that he, and the rest of his country, had to pay.The destruction. The visions. The dying. PRAISE FOR 'THE STONE MAN': \"Once again believable characters and a mind blowing story, and when Luke Smitherd is recognised as the great writer he is he is bound to be compared to the likes of James Herbert and Stephen King.\"-Scrooby1, Amazon UK Review \"Tremendous. I was looking for something completely original and different, this nailed it spot on. Highly recommended.\"-Neil Novita, Amazon USA Review \"I have owned a Kindle for about 2 years and downloaded some excellent books for very little cost but Luke Smitherd's works beat the lot\"-Silversmith, Amazon UK Review \"This ebook was fantastic and totally different from any other sci-fi thriller I've ever read...I kept thinking 'What if...what if...'-Carl Law, Amazon US Review \"It was one of those books where you tell yourself you will read just one more page, then look at the clock and realise that it's 2 hours later , I would thoroughly recommend it\"-Elaine Hosegood, Amazon UK Review \"As soon as I started reading I was completely sucked in, which very rarely happens for me. I couldn't wait to get home and read it each night. I laughed. I cried. I did actual real life gasps of horror.\"-Katie, Amazon UK Review \"Fantastically written characters who make you care about them right from the off, an unfathomable villain who defies all understanding and a supporting cast that flesh out the story beautifully.\"-Andy Pettifer, Goodreads Review \"I spend a lot of time trawling through the kindle book store looking for cheap books, relying on reviews to make my purchases. I have come across some less than average books using this method, but also some real gems. This book definitely falls into the latter category. It had me gripped from page one right through to the Alternative Ending Synopsis at the end. The other reviews leave me little to say other than thanks Luke.\"-Steve Sut, Amazon UK Review \"So good the first thing I did after I put it down was to download his other two books.\"-Miss H. L. Smith, Amazon UK Review \"This book starts with a bang and doesn't let up. I read this in two sittings. Recommended.\"-Dickydavis, Goodreads review \"A very enjoyable read and cracking value at the price.Do not be put off by Science Fiction or Horror in the title if they are not your bag, this is an inteligent and thought provoking read. Highly recommended.\"-Dave Osborn, Amazon UK Review \"I literally found this hard to stop reading,I wanted to know the answers.I have been around a good while so have read all of Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury etc. and I would genuinely put this author in the same class as these class acts.\"-K Murphy, Amazon UK Review \"...so my 5-star review? That's five stars in comparison to REAL books; not just the stuff you'll find self-published on Kindle.

If you are interested in science or fascinated with the future then science fiction is where you explore new ideas and let your dreams and nightmares duke it out on the safety of the page or screen. But what if we could use science fiction to do more than that? What if we could use science fiction based on science fact to not only imagine our future but develop new technologies and products? What if we could use stories, movies and comics as a kind of tool to explore the real world implications and uses of future technologies today? Science Fiction Prototyping is a practical guide to using fiction as a way to imagine our future in a whole new way. Filled with history, real world examples and conversations with experts like best selling science fiction author Cory Doctorow, senior editor at Dark Horse Comics Chris Warner and Hollywood science expert Sidney Perkowitz, Science Fiction Prototyping will give you the tools you need to begin designing the future with science fiction. The future is Brian David Johnson\u2019s business. As a futurist at Intel Corporation, his charter is to develop an actionable vision for computing in 2021. His work is called \u201cfuture casting\u201d\u2014using ethnographic field studies, technology research, trend data, and even science fiction to create a pragmatic vision of consumers and computing.

        "description": "Before there was Superman or Batman, before Ray Bradbury or Harlan Ellison ever picked up a pen, before there were science-fiction fans and conventions, there was Julius Schwartz -- a man who would have an indelible effect on all this and more. One of the inventors of science-fiction fandom in the thirties and publisher of the first SF \"fanzine\" (one of its early subscribers was Superman's cocreator Jerry Siegel), Julius Schwartz became the world's first SF specialty literary agent while still in his teens. During the \"Golden Age\" of science fiction, he represented a distinguished roster of authors, including H. P. Lovecraft, Alfred Bester, Robert Bloch, and Ray Bradbury. But that was only the first chapter in Schwartzs amazing career, for he is also one of the most influential editors in comic-book history. Besides working on both the Superman and Batman character she created much of the mythology we now take for granted. Schwartz was also responsible for revitalizing nearly every important DC Comics character, highlighted by the mighty Justice League of America, in what has since become known as comics' beloved \"Silver Age.\" Over more than forty years, Schwartz captained such blazing talents of the comics industry as Bob Kane, Bill Finger, Curt Swan, Neal Adams, Denny O'Neil, Alan Moore, and many others. Here, in \"Julie's\" own words, is a behind-the-scenes look at a life spent having fun and making sure readers did, too -- the incredible story of a true hero of American pop culture.",

Delving deeply into the work of major figures in the field - from Jack Kirby's cosmic superhero sagas and Philip K. Dick's futuristic head-trips to Alan Moore's sex magic and Whitley Strieber's communion with visitors - Kripal shows how creators turned to science fiction to convey the reality of the inexplicable and the paranormal they experienced in their lives. Expanded consciousness found its language in the metaphors of sci-fi - incredible powers, unprecedented mutations, time-loops and vast intergalactic intelligences - and the deeper influences of mythology and religion that these in turn drew from ; the wildly creative work that followed caught the imaginations of millions. Moving deftly from Cold War science and Fredric Wertham's anticomics crusade to gnostic revelation and alien abduction, Kripal spins out a hidden history of American culture, rich with mythical themes and shot through with an awareness that there are other realities far beyond our everyday understanding.\"--Jacket.",

        "author": "Timothy Zahn",
        "description": "From Timothy Zahn, Hugo Award winner and New York Times bestselling author of two landmark Star Wars\u00ae series, comes an original new tale featuring a renegade space pilot, his unusual alien partner, and an unknown cargo that can change the course of galactic history. Jordan McKell has a problem with authority. Unfortunately for him, the iron-fisted authority of the powerful Patthaaunutth controls virtually every aspect of galactic shipping. In order to survive, Jordan ekes out a living dabbling in interstellar smuggling for outlaw concerns that represent the last vestiges of free trade in the galaxy. So when Jordan and his partner, Ixil--an alien with two ferret-like \"outhunters\" linked to his neural system--are hired by a mysterious gentleman to fly a ship and its special cargo to Earth, they jump at the job. Caution has never been one of Jordan's strong suits. But this time he may have taken on more than even he can handle. The ship, Icarus, turns out to be a ramshackle hulk, the ragtag crew literally picked up off the street, and the cargo so secret, it's sealed in a special container that takes up most of the cramped and ill-designed ship. As if that weren't bad enough, it looks like the authorities already suspect something is afoot, there's a saboteur aboard, and the Icarus appears to be shaking apart at the seams. It doesn't seem as if things could get any worse. That is, until a beautiful crew member helps McKell uncover the true nature of the cargo he's carrying. With his enemies closing in on the lumbering Icarus, the unknown saboteur still aboard, and authorities on Earth pressured to turn them in, McKell and Ixil become fugitives. Their only chance is to stay one step ahead of their pursuers as they try to make it home. A bold and epic novel filled with unrelenting action and a good dose of humor, The Icarus Hunt is a wild hyperspace romp through the galaxy.",

In The Mirror of Her Dreams, the astonishing first novel in the two-volume Mordant\u2019s Need series, Donaldson shows us a world of wondrous beauty and seductive illusion, where mirrors hold the deadliest of magics and nothing is what it seems. . . . The daughter of rich but neglectful parents, Terisa Morgan lives alone in a New York City apartment, a young woman who has grown to doubt her own existence. Surrounded by the flat reassurance of mirrors, she leads an unfulfilled life\u2014until the night a strange man named Geraden comes crashing through one of her mirrors, on a quest to find a champion to save his kingdom of Mordant from a pervasive evil that threatens the land. Terisa is no champion. She wields neither magic nor power. And yet, much to her own surprise, when Geraden begs her to come back with him, she agrees. Now, in a culture where women are little more than the playthings of powerful men, in a castle honeycombed with secret passages and clever traps, in a kingdom threatened from without and within by enemies able to appear and vanish out of thin air, Terisa must become more than the pale reflection of a person. For the way back to Earth is closed to her. And the enemies of Mordant will stop at nothing to see her dead.",

High-tech SF has made a significant comeback in the last decade, as bestselling authors successfully blend the super-science of 'hard science fiction' with real characters in an understandable scenario. It is perhaps a reflection of how technologically controlled our world is that readers increasingly look for science fiction that considers the fates of mankind as a result of increasing scientific domination. This anthology brings together the most extreme examples of the new high-tech, far-future science fiction, pushing the limits way beyond normal boundaries. The stories include: \"A Perpetual War Fought Within a Cosmic String\", \"A Weapon That Could Destroy the Universe\", \"A Machine That Detects Alternate Worlds and Creates a Choice of Christs\", \"An Immortal Dead Man Sent To The End of the Universe\", \"Murder in Virtual Reality\", \"A Spaceship So Large That There is An Entire Planetary System Within It\", and \"An Analytical Engine At The End of Time\", and \"Encountering the Untouchable.\"",

A strange man discovers our nameless narrator selling popcorn at a decrepit small-town movie theater and offers her an odd and lucrative position: she will forget her job, her acquaintances, even her name, and move to Los Angeles, where she will become the body double of the famous and troubled celebrity Rosanna Feld. A nervous breakdown has forced Rosanna out of the public eye, and she needs a look-alike to take her place in the tabloid media circus of Hollywood. Overseen by Max, who hired her for the job, our narrator spends her days locked up in a small apartment in the hills watching hidden camera footage of Rosanna, wearing Rosanna's clothes, eating the food Rosanna likes, practicing her mannerisms, learning to become Rosanna in every way. But as she makes her public debut as Rosanna, alarming questions begin to arise. What really caused Rosanna's mental collapse? Will she ever return? And is Max truly her ally, or something more sinister?",

In the aftermath of the zombie virus outbreak, what remains of the Chinese government has estimated that one billion walkers (called jiangshi) are currently roaming through the country. Across this dramatic landscape, large groups of survivors have clustered together for safety in villages and towns that have been built vertically as a means of protection against the unceasing wave of jiangshi.

Hengyen was a grizzled military officer of some renown, and a passionate believer in his nation\u2019s ability to surmount any obstacle. But with the settlement\u2019s 3,000 mouths to feed and the scavengers having to travel further and further in search of food, Zhu ends up at his home village, where he is shocked to find survivors.

It reaches into that endless cosmos with the tools of rational investigation and storytelling. At the core of both science and science fiction is the engaged human mind--a consciousness that sees and feels and thinks and loves. But what is this mind, this aware and self-aware consciousness that seems unlike anything else we experience? What makes consciousness the Hard Problem of philosophy, still unsolved after millennia of probing? This book looks into the heart of this mystery - at the science and philosophy of consciousness and at many inspiring fictional examples - and finds strange, challenging answers. The book's content and entertaining style will appeal equally to science fiction enthusiasts and scholars, including cognitive and neuroscientists, as well as philosophers of mind.

As an up-and-coming YouTube star, Bethany had more than one viewer waiting for her to fall from grace. Determined to prove there's a killer on the loose, Odessa takes matters into her own hands.

Surviving the crash of their small plane in northern Canada, the five awaken to find themselves in Dema-Ki, an uncharted valley inhabited by a mysterious people. Nursed back to health, the teenagers are soon cast into a life-altering adventure when a strange affliction wreaks havoc in this remote sanctuary. The Elders of the village believe that the five newcomers hold the key to the salvation of not only Dema-Ki, but that of all humanity as foretold in their prophecy. Skeptical at first, the five eventually grow to accept the possibilities of the prophecy after experiencing a series of baffling events. Unbeknownst to them, a renegade group of youths, zealously opposed to the initiation of the 'outsiders', soon begin their maneuvers to rid the village of the newcomers. As the dark forces around them accelerate, the five friends are compelled to discover faith in themselves and in the powers ascribed to them by the ancient prophecy. If they survive the perils in this valley, can they then garner the courage and conviction needed to face an ominous cloud gathering in the world outside?",

Burdened by a crushing debt that rules out college, Tanner enlists in the navy of Archangel, a star system with four terraformed worlds. But he hasn't factored in the space pirates. Just as Tanner begins basic training, the government ramps up its forces to confront a band of rowdy raiders who are wreaking havoc in the void.

Assigned to the front lines, Tanner soon finds himself caught in the crossfire between ruthless foes, cruel comrades, and unforgiving space. Can he do his duty when good and evil look so much alike?",

When a strange rescue signal comes in, Sever Squad gets the call. They're tough, reckless, and one carries a giant hammer. Except this mission's different: the signal's calling for help, but the planet's deserted. Oh, and Sever's home ship can't wait for them. If they want to get off-world with their rescue, they'll have to find their own way to fly. For Aurora and the rest of Sever, though, the mission means serious cash. A chance to get out of the grind, find something that doesn't require getting lit up by lasers every other day. So the choice is obvious: load up, and move out. Drop Zone kicks off the Sever Squad series, a fast-paced sci-fi action blend that takes a battle-hardened crew to strange worlds, trigger-happy enemies, and fair-weather friends. If you're looking for your next adventure, strap on your power armor and join Sever in the drop shuttle. It's going to be a bumpy ride.",

Learn how to pack your pages with action, from beginnings that grab to endings that leave your readers begging for more from the author of more than 180 novels. \"A vital book for authors wishing to add impact to their fiction. ...a very good analysis of the genre markets, a deft guide to the craft of modern fiction writing, & a glimpse into the life of the best-selling novelist-not the gazillionaires like King or Koontz of Mailer or whoever, but the scrivener who just makes a nice living at cranking out entertainment for the rest of us. Newton shows you many passages that don't quite make the grade (but went to press anyway, because that's often how it works) & chunks that he feels are golden. He berates you to make it all larger-than-life-that's the market!-but also stops you short of falling to mawkish self-parody. This is certainly a vital book for the mystery writer & those who do war stories, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a tonic before writing Western, Gothic, space adventure, or quest fantasy. It's worth ten bucks, & certainly a fiver, even though the world has changed so much since 1989.\" -Anthony D. Ravenscroft, Amazon.com reviewer",

No wonder she\u2019s called the Iron Bitch. Now, on the run from Imperial starcruisers, shady mercenaries, and just about everyone else in the Empire, Owen\u2019s options are limited. Though the name Deathstalker still commands respect in certain quarters, out on the Rim, Owen is lucky he can cobble together a makeshift team of castoffs, including an ex-pirate, a cyborg, and a bounty hunter. But allies won\u2019t be enough to save him. If he\u2019s to live, Owen can either run forever...or take down the corrupt Empire. To do that, he\u2019ll need the fabled Darkvoid Device\u2014an artifact dating back to the first Deathstalker and perhaps the only weapon powerful enough to help this ragtag rebellion win. The time has come for Owen to finally embrace his Deathstalker heritage...and all the blood and death that go along with it.

There was a time known as the Grind\u2014when Freeman's people lived as slaves to another race referred to simply as \"Master.\" They were property. But a civil rights movement emerged. Change seemed near, but the Masters refused to bend. Instead, they declared war. And lost. Now, the freed world is threatened by a virus, spread through bites, sweeping through the population. Those infected are propelled to violence, driven to disperse the virus. Uniquely suited to respond to this new threat, Freeman searches for a cure, but instead finds the source\u2014the Masters, intent on reclaiming the world. Freeman must fight for his life, for his friends and for the truth, which is far more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined. Robinson's lightning fast, cutting-edge novels have won over thriller, horror, science-fiction and action/adventure fans alike, and he has received high praise from peers like James Rollins, Jonathan Maberry, and Scott Sigler.
